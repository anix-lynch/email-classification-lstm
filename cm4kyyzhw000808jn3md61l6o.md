This standard "Chat with PDF" app provides a great baseline for understanding and applying these tools effectively!

### **Sample Case: Chat with PDF**

#### 1\. **Problem Statement**

Enable users to upload a PDF and ask questions about its content using an LLM.

---

#### 2\. **Keyword Breakdown and Relevance**

| **Keyword** | **Contribution to Chat with PDF** | **Example Tools** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | Choose an LLM (e.g., GPT, Llama 2) for text-based tasks. | Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API, For multilingual go for Gemini |
| **Serving** | Deploy the LLM with a scalable API endpoint. | FastAPI, TorchServe, OpenLLM |
| **Observability** | Monitor API usage, errors in PDF parsing, and LLM responses. | Prometheus, Grafana |
| **Security** | Ensure safe PDF input parsing, avoid prompt injections. | Input sanitization libraries, LangChainâ€™s safeguards |
| **LLMOps** | Manage model lifecycle, version control, and update the prompt template as PDF complexity changes. | LangChain, Mirascope |
| **Search** | Use vector search for efficient retrieval of PDF embeddings (relevant sections). | FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma |
| **Code AI** | Automate repetitive coding tasks like extracting data from PDFs. | Copilot, Codex |
| **Foundation Model Fine-Tuning** | Fine-tune a model for specific document types (e.g., contracts or academic papers). | Hugging Face Trainer |
| **Frameworks for Training** | Train a custom model if the pre-trained model does not perform well on PDFs. | PyTorch, TensorFlow |
| **Experiment Tracking** | Track fine-tuning runs to compare performance. | Weights & Biases, MLflow |
| **Visualization** | Create dashboards for embedding distributions or model responses. | Matplotlib, Streamlit |
| **Data Management** | Store and organize uploaded PDFs for indexing. | Airtable, PostgreSQL |
| **Data Tracking** | Log data ingestion steps and transformations. | Pandas, DVC (Data Version Control) |
| **Feature Engineering** | Extract text, tables, and images from PDFs. | PyPDF2, PDFPlumber |
| **Data/Feature Enrichment** | Enhance extracted content by adding metadata (e.g., section titles or timestamps). | spaCy, Named Entity Recognition (NER) |
| **ML Platforms** | Scale the pipeline to handle large numbers of PDFs. | AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI |
| **Workflow and Scheduling** | Automate PDF ingestion and embedding updates. | Apache Airflow, Prefect |
| **Profiling** | Optimize runtime of text extraction and embedding generation. | PyTorch Profiler, cProfile |
| **AutoML** | Automate hyperparameter tuning for fine-tuning or model selection. | Auto-sklearn, Hugging Face AutoTrain |
| **Optimizations** | Reduce inference latency (e.g., quantization or caching embeddings). | ONNX, Hugging Face Optimum |
| **Federated ML** | Collaborate across devices for privacy-preserving fine-tuning (if sensitive data). | PySyft, TensorFlow Federated |

#### 3\. **Workflow Example**

1. **Upload PDF**: User uploads a file.
    
2. **Preprocessing**: Extract text and embeddings using `PyPDF2` + `FAISS`.
    
3. **Search**: Query embeddings to find relevant sections of the PDF.
    
4. **Model Response**: Use LLM (via Hugging Face or OpenAI API) to generate answers.
    
5. **Monitoring**: Track queries and response times using Prometheus.
    
6. **Security**: Sanitize input and outputs for malicious content.
