# **1\. Fully Connected Neural Network (Feedforward Network)**

* **Use case**: <mark>Very versatile</mark>. Useful for a wide variety of tasks involving structured, tabular data. They work well for both **classification** (binary/multiclass) and **regression** tasks, where the goal is to predict a target value (either categorical or continuous) based on a set of input features.
    
* **Common Layers**: `Dense`
    
* **Settings**:
    
    * **Neurons**: The number of neurons (units) in the layer, usually a power of 2 (e.g., 32, 64, 128).
        
    * **Activation**: Determines how the neuron’s output is computed, commonly `'relu'` for hidden layers and `'softmax'` for the output layer in classification.
        
* **Import Pattern**:
    

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

* * Use **Dense** layers <mark>when you want each neuron to be connected to every neuron in the next layer</mark>.
        
* **Initialization**:
    
    * **Input Layer**:
        
        ```python
        model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))
        ```
        
        * `input_dim`: Number of input features.
            
    * **Hidden Layer**:
        
        ```python
        model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
        ```
        
    * **Output Layer** (for classification):
        
        ```python
        model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
        ```
        

Here’s a **full code** example for a **Fully Connected Neural Network (Feedforward Network)** using **Keras** to solve a simple classification task (e.g., classifying the **<mark>Iris dataset</mark>**<mark>),</mark> followed by a demo output:

**Full Code Example**

```python
# Import required libraries
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features
y = iris.target  # Target classes

# One-Hot encode the target classes (for multi-class classification)
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
y_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(y.reshape(-1, 1))

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y_encoded, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Input Layer (with input dimension)
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))

# Hidden Layer
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))

# Output Layer (for 3 classes, using softmax)
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model (with optimizer, loss function, and metrics)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = y_pred.argmax(axis=1)
y_test_classes = y_test.argmax(axis=1)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_classes, y_pred_classes)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Demo output: Display the final test accuracy and a sample of predictions
print("Sample predictions (True class vs Predicted class):")
for i in range(5):
    print(f"True: {y_test_classes[i]}, Predicted: {y_pred_classes[i]}")
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **Data Preparation**:
    
    * We load the **Iris dataset**, which contains 150 samples of 3 classes of flowers.
        
    * Features (`X`) include measurements like sepal length, petal length, etc.
        
    * <mark>We </mark> **<mark>One-Hot Encode</mark>** <mark> the target classes because the output layer uses </mark> `softmax` <mark> for multi-class classification.</mark>
        
2. **Model Architecture**:
    
    * The **input layer** has 64 neurons and uses the `relu` activation function.
        
    * A **hidden layer** with 64 neurons is added, also using `relu`.
        
    * The **output layer** has 3 neurons (one for each class) with `softmax` for multi-class classification.
        
    * **<mark>ReLU</mark>** <mark> is applied in the input and hidden layers to allow the model to learn non-linear relationship</mark>s between the features (sepal/petal lengths and widths) and the target classes (species). <mark>It solves the problem of vanishing gradients. It simply outputs the input if positive, or zero otherwise</mark>
        
3. **Model Training**:
    
    * We compile the model using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy** as the loss function.
        
    * Adam combines the benefits of **both momentum** and **RMSProp.** It adapts the learning rate during training
        
    * **<mark>Adam</mark>** <mark> is chosen because it offers fast convergence without the need for manual tuning of the learning rate</mark>, which is particularly useful in this small dataset scenario.
        
    * **Categorical Crossentropy** is used when performing **multi-class classification** <mark>where each sample belongs to one of several possible categories.</mark>
        
    * If the true class is 1 (one-hot encoded as `[0, 1, 0]`) and softmax predicts `[0.2, 0.7, 0.1]`, **<mark>categorical crossentropy</mark>** <mark> calculates the loss by comparing how close the predicted probability </mark> (0.7 for class 1) is to the true value (1). A good prediction like `[0.2, 0.7, 0.1]` results in low loss, while a bad prediction like `[0.6, 0.2, 0.2]` results in higher loss.
        
    * The model is trained for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 10, and we also validate on 20% of the training data.
        
4. **Evaluation**:
    
    * We evaluate the model on the test data and print the accuracy score.
        

### **Demo Output**:

```plaintext
Test Accuracy: 0.98
Sample predictions (True class vs Predicted class):
True: 1, Predicted: 1
True: 2, Predicted: 2
True: 1, Predicted: 1
True: 0, Predicted: 0
True: 1, Predicted: 1
```

### **Key Points**:

* The **test accuracy** of 0.98 (98%) shows that the model is performing well.
    
* A few **sample predictions** (true vs predicted classes) are displayed to demonstrate the model’s classification accuracy.

---

### **Settings**:

* **Filters**: Number of filters (e.g., 32, 64) used in the convolutional layers to extract different features from the images.

### **Full Code Example**:

```python
# Import required libraries
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset (handwritten digit classification)
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255

### **Explanation of the Code**:

#### **Data Preparation**:

* We load the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0–9).
    
* The data is reshaped to fit the CNN architecture with a shape of `(28, 28, 1)` (height, width, channels).
    
* The pixel values are normalized, and the target labels are **one-hot encoded** because we are doing **multi-class classification**.
    

#### **Model Architecture**:

* **Conv2D Layer**: Applies 32 filters of size `(3, 3)` to extract features from the images.
    
* **MaxPooling2D Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the image, focusing on important features.
    
* **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D feature map into a 1D vector.
    
* **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification, with 128 neurons in the hidden layer and 10 neurons in the output layer (one for each digit).
    

#### **Model Training**:

* The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy** as the loss function.
    
* We train the model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, and validate on 20% of the training data.
    

#### **Evaluation**:

* We evaluate the model on the test data and print the accuracy score.
    

---

### **Demo Output**:

```plaintext
Test Accuracy: 0.99
```

### **Key Points**:

* The test accuracy of 0.99 (99%) shows that the CNN is performing well on the handwritten digit classification task.
    
* CNNs are ideal for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and detect patterns from image data.
    
* You can adjust the number of filters, kernel sizes, or epochs to improve performance or reduce computational complexity.

# **3\. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**

#### **Use Case**:

* **RNNs** are designed for handling **sequential data** where the order of the data points is important.
    
* They are ideal for tasks like **time series forecasting**, **text generation**, **speech recognition**, or **sentiment analysis**.
    

#### **Common Layers**:

* **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory units, a popular type of RNN layer that helps retain information over long sequences and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.
    
* **<mark>GRU</mark>**<mark>: Gated Recurrent Units, another type of RNN layer that is computationally efficient and similar to LSTM.</mark>
    
* **Dense**: Fully connected layers for final classification or regression.
    

---

### **Settings**:

* **Units**: The number of units (e.g., 50, 100) in the LSTM or GRU layers to capture patterns in the sequence.
    
* **Activation**: Commonly `'tanh'` for LSTM/GRU layers and `'softmax'` for classification tasks.
    

---

### **Import Pattern**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

---

### **Explanation**:

* **LSTM/GRU**: These layers are designed to remember information over sequences and prevent the vanishing gradient problem that regular RNNs face.
    
* **Dense**: After learning from the sequence, Dense layers are used to make predictions (either class labels or continuous values).
    

---

### **Initialization**:

#### **LSTM Layer**:

```python
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='tanh', input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
```

* `50`: Number of units in the LSTM layer.
    
* `input_shape`: `(timesteps, features)` refers to the length of the sequence and the number of features per timestep.
    

#### **Dense Layer**:

```python
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # For binary classification or regression
```

---

### **Full Code Example**:

This example demonstrates an RNN for **sequence classification** using the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis (classifying movie reviews as positive or negative).

```python
# Import required libraries
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import sequence

# Load the IMDB dataset (only the top 10,000 words are kept)
max_features = 10000
max_len = 100  # We will pad sequences to a maximum length of 100 words

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max_features)

# Pad the sequences to ensure they all have the same length
X_train = sequence.pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_len)
X_test = sequence.pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_len)

# Initialize the Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Add LSTM and Dense layers
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='tanh', input_shape=(max_len, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # Binary classification (positive/negative sentiment)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}")
```

---

### **Explanation of the Code**:

#### **Data Preparation**:

* We load the **IMDB dataset**, which consists of movie reviews that are classified as either **positive** or **negative** (binary classification).
    
* The data is preprocessed by padding the sequences to ensure they are all the same length (`max_len = 100`), so they can be passed into the RNN.
    

#### **Model Architecture**:

* **LSTM Layer**: The LSTM layer with 50 units processes sequences of word indices from the IMDB dataset. It captures patterns in the sequence of words to make predictions about the sentiment of the review.
    
* **Dense Layer**: The final Dense layer with a `sigmoid` activation is used for binary classification (positive or negative sentiment).
    

#### **Model Training**:

* We compile the model using the **Adam optimizer** and **binary crossentropy** as the loss function (because it's a binary classification problem).
    
* The model is trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 64.
    

#### **Evaluation**:

* We evaluate the model on the test data and print the accuracy score.
    

---

### **Demo Output**:

```plaintext
Test Accuracy: 0.85
```

---

### **Key Points**:

* **LSTM layers** help capture long-term dependencies in the sequence, making them ideal for sequential data like text or time series.
    
* <mark>The test accuracy of 85% demonstrates that the RNN is effective for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.</mark>
    
* You can experiment with the number of LSTM units, epochs, or different datasets to see how it impacts the model's performance.
    

---

# **4\. Autoencoder**

#### **Use Case**:

* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Autoencoders can compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important features. This is useful for tasks like data compression or feature extraction.
    
* **Denoising**: Autoencoders can be trained to reconstruct data from noisy inputs, effectively removing noise and recovering clean data.
    

#### **Common Layers**:

* **Dense**: Fully connected layers are used in both the encoder and decoder.
    
* **Flatten and Reshape**: Convert data between different shapes when moving from higher dimensions to lower dimensions and back.
    

---

### **Settings**:

* **Neurons**: The number of neurons in the encoding/decoding layers. This controls the dimensionality of the compressed (encoded) representation.
    
* **Activation**: `relu` is commonly used for hidden layers, and `sigmoid` or `linear` is often used for the output layer.
    

---

### **Import Pattern**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Reshape
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

---

### **Initialization**:

#### **Encoder (Dense Layers)**:

```python
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))
```

* `input_dim`: Number of input features.
    
* `128`: Number of neurons for encoding.
    

#### **Latent Space**:

```python
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))  # Encodes the data into 32-dimensional space
```

#### **Decoder**:

```python
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid'))  # Output layer for reconstruction
```

---

### **Full Code Example**:

This example demonstrates a simple autoencoder for **dimensionality reduction** using the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits). We compress the images and then reconstruct them.

```python
# Import required libraries
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Reshape
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
(X_train, _), (X_test, _) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Flatten the images into 1D vectors (28x28 -> 784)
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28 * 28)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28 * 28)

# Initialize the Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Encoder
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(28 * 28,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))  # Intermediate encoding layer
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))  # Latent space representation

# Decoder
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))  # Rebuild from latent space
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(28 * 28, activation='sigmoid'))  # Output layer (same size as input)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, X_train, epochs=10, batch_size=256, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
reconstructed = model.predict(X_test)

# Reshape the reconstructed images for visualization
reconstructed = reconstructed.reshape(-1, 28, 28)

# Display a sample of original and reconstructed images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 5
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
for i in range(n):
    # Display original images
    ax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(X_test[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title("Original")
    ax.axis('off')

    # Display reconstructed images
    ax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1 + n)
    plt.imshow(reconstructed[i], cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title("Reconstructed")
    ax.axis('off')

plt.show()
```

---

### **Explanation of the Code**:

#### **Data Preparation**:

* We load the **MNIST dataset** and normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.
    
* The images are **flattened** from 2D (28x28 pixels) to 1D vectors (784 pixels) so that they can be processed by the fully connected (Dense) layers of the autoencoder.
    

#### **Model Architecture**:

* **Encoder**: Consists of three Dense layers that compress the 784-dimensional input into a **32-dimensional latent space**.
    
* **Decoder**: Mirrors the encoder, reconstructing the original input from the latent space.
    
* **Output Layer**: The final layer uses a **sigmoid activation** to output values between 0 and 1, matching the normalized pixel values.
    

#### **Model Training**:

* We compile the model using the **Adam optimizer** and **<mark>mean squared error (MSE)</mark>** <mark> as the loss function, as we are comparing the reconstructed images with the original images.</mark>
    
* The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 256, and we validate on 20% of the training data.
    

#### **Evaluation**:

* We use the model to **reconstruct** the test images and visualize how closely the reconstructed images match the original images.
    

---

### **Demo Output**:

After running the code, <mark>you will see a </mark> **<mark>side-by-side comparison</mark>** <mark> of the original and reconstructed images. The goal of the autoencoder is to compress the data and then accurately reconstruct it.</mark>

---

# **5\. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

#### **Use Case**:

* **Image Generation**: GANs are commonly used to generate new, synthetic images that look like real ones.
    
* **Data Augmentation**: GANs can create synthetic data to augment datasets.
    
* **Super-Resolution**: They can be used to generate high-resolution images from lower-resolution inputs.
    

#### **How GANs Work**:

* **<mark>Generator</mark>**<mark>: The generator network creates fake images from random noise.</mark>
    
* **<mark>Discriminator</mark>**<mark>: The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real images and fake images generated by the generator.</mark>
    
* <mark>The two networks are trained together in a competitive setting where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to avoid being fooled.</mark>
    

#### **Common Layers**:

* **Dense**: Used in both the generator and discriminator.
    
* **<mark>Conv2DTranspose</mark>**<mark>: Used in the generator to upsample (create images)</mark>.
    
* **Conv2D**: Used in the discriminator to downsample images and classify them as real or fake.
    
* **<mark>LeakyReLU</mark>**<mark>: Activation function often used in GANs for better gradient flow.</mark>
    

---

### **Settings**:

* **<mark>Latent Dimension</mark>**<mark>: The size of the random noise </mark> vector used as input to the generator.
    
* **Filters**: Number of filters used in Conv2D layers for both upsampling and downsampling.
    
* **Activation**: `LeakyReLU` is commonly used for GANs, especially in the discriminator, <mark>because it helps avoid the problem of dying neurons.</mark>
    

---

### **Import Pattern**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Conv2DTranspose, LeakyReLU, Flatten, Reshape
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

---

### **Explanation**:

* **Generator**: Takes a random noise vector and generates an image from it.
    
* **Discriminator**: Takes an image (real or fake) and classifies it as either real or fake.
    

---

### **Initialization**:

#### **Generator**:

```python
generator = Sequential()
generator.add(Dense(128 * 7 * 7, activation="relu", input_dim=100))
generator.add(Reshape((7, 7, 128)))
generator.add(Conv2DTranspose(128, (4, 4), strides=(2, 2), padding="same"))
generator.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
generator.add(Conv2DTranspose(64, (4, 4), strides=(2, 2), padding="same"))
generator.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
generator.add(Conv2D(1, (7, 7), activation="sigmoid", padding="same"))
```

* `input_dim=100`: The size of the noise vector.
    
* `Conv2DTranspose`: Used to upsample the input to the generator.
    

#### **Discriminator**:

```python
discriminator = Sequential()
discriminator.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding="same", input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
discriminator.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
discriminator.add(Flatten())
discriminator.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```

* The discriminator is a simple binary classifier with a `sigmoid` output.

### **Explanation of the Code**:

#### **Data Preparation**:

* We load the **MNIST dataset** and normalize the pixel values to be between **\-1 and 1** to match the **tanh activation** used in the generator's output.
    
* The images are reshaped to include a channel dimension `(28, 28, 1)`.
    

#### **Model Architecture**:

* **Generator**: Takes a random noise vector (`latent_dim=100`) and gradually upsamples it using `Conv2DTranspose` layers to generate a 28x28 image.
    
* **Discriminator**: Takes in an image (real or generated) and uses `Conv2D` layers to classify the image as real or fake.
    

#### **Model Training**:

* The **discriminator** is trained on real and fake images separately, with labels `1` for real and `0` for fake.
    
* The **generator** is trained via the GAN model, aiming to fool the discriminator into classifying generated images as real.
    
* The two models are trained in an adversarial manner, improving over time.
    

#### **Evaluation**:

* After training, the generator is used to generate new images from random noise, and these images are visualized.
    

---

### **Demo Output**:

After running the code, you will see **generated images** of handwritten digits that resemble those from the MNIST dataset.

# 6\. Transformer Models

#### **Use Case**:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Transformers are designed for sequence tasks such as text classification, machine translation, question answering, and text generation.
    
* **Highly parallelizable**: <mark>Unlike RNNs, transformers can process entire sequences simultaneously,</mark> making them faster and more efficient for training on large datasets.
    

#### **How Transformers Work**:

* **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformers rely heavily on attention mechanisms, specifically self-attention, to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
    
* **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers don’t inherently understand sequence order (like RNNs), they use positional encoding to keep track of the position of words in a sequence.
    

#### **Common Layers**:

* **<mark>MultiHeadAttention</mark>**<mark>: The core layer that performs attention over multiple heads.</mark>
    
* **Dense**: Fully connected layers used after the attention mechanism.
    
* **<mark>LayerNormalization</mark>**<mark>: Normalizes the output </mark> at each step to stabilize training.
    
* **<mark>Embedding</mark>**<mark>: Converts words into vector representations </mark> (used for NLP tasks).
    

---

### **Settings**:

* **Attention Heads**: The number of attention heads (e.g., 8, 12), which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
    
* **Hidden Units**: The number of neurons in the fully connected layers after attention.
    
* **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to input sequences.
    

---

### **Import Pattern**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MultiHeadAttention, Dense, LayerNormalization, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

---

### **Initialization**:

#### **<mark>Embedding Layer</mark>**<mark>:</mark>

```python
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim))
```

* `vocab_size`<mark>: Number of words in the vocabulary</mark>.
    
* `embedding_dim`: Size of the word vectors.
    

#### **<mark>MultiHeadAttention Layer</mark>**<mark>:</mark>

```python
model.add(MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=8, key_dim=64))
```

* `num_heads`: Number of attention heads.
    
* `key_dim`: Dimensionality of the attention keys.
    

---

### **Full Code Example**:

This example demonstrates a simple transformer-based model for **text classification** using the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis (classifying movie reviews as positive or negative).

```python
# Import required libraries
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, MultiHeadAttention, Dense, LayerNormalization, GlobalAveragePooling1D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Load the IMDB dataset
vocab_size = 10000
max_len = 100

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=vocab_size)

# Pad the sequences to ensure they all have the same length
X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_len)
X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_len)

# Set up model parameters
embedding_dim = 128
num_heads = 8
key_dim = 64

# Initialize the Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Embedding Layer: Converts input words into embeddings
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_len))

# Multi-Head Attention Layer
model.add(MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=key_dim))

# Add LayerNormalization
model.add(LayerNormalization())

# Global Average Pooling to reduce the sequence output to a fixed-size vector
model.add(GlobalAveragePooling1D())

# Dense output layer for binary classification
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}")
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

#### **Data Preparation**:

* We load the **IMDB dataset** for **sentiment analysis**, where movie reviews are classified as **positive** or **negative**.
    
* The data is padded to ensure all sequences have the same length (`max_len = 100`).
    

#### **Model Architecture**:

* **<mark>Embedding Layer</mark>**<mark>: Converts words into vectors of size </mark> `128`<mark>.</mark>
    
* **<mark>MultiHeadAttention Layer</mark>**<mark>: Uses 8 attention heads to focus on different parts of the input sequence. Each attention head has a key dimension (</mark>`key_dim=64`<mark>).</mark>
    
* **<mark>LayerNormalization</mark>**<mark>: Ensures the output is normalized, helping the model stabilize during training.</mark>
    
* **<mark>Global Average Pooling</mark>**<mark>: Reduces the sequence output to a single vector, which is then passed to the dense layer for classification.</mark>
    
* **Dense Layer**: The final layer with a `sigmoid` activation is used for binary classification.
    

#### **Model Training**:

* The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and **<mark>binary crossentropy</mark>** <mark> as the loss function (since this is a binary classification task).</mark>
    
* The model is trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 64.
    

#### **Evaluation**:

* The model is evaluated on the test data, and the accuracy is printed.

### **Demo Output**:

### **Key Points**:

* **Transformer models** are extremely powerful for handling **sequence tasks**, especially in NLP, because of their **attention mechanisms**.
    
* <mark>By focusing on different parts of the input simultaneously, transformers can understand complex relationships between words or tokens in a sequence, leading to better performance than traditional RNNs.</mark>
    
* The transformer in this example achieves a **test accuracy of 85%** on the IMDB sentiment analysis task.

# **7\. Residual Networks (ResNet)**

#### **Use Case**:

* **Deep Learning for Image Classification**: ResNets are used for training very deep neural networks by addressing the **vanishing gradient problem**.
    
* **<mark>Computer Vision</mark>**: They are popular for tasks like image classification (e.g., **ImageNet**), object detection, and segmentation.
    

#### **How ResNet Works**:

* ResNet introduces **skip connections** (or residual connections) that allow gradients to flow through the network more easily. <mark> This helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem in very deep networks by allowing the network to “skip” layers during training and makes it possible to train models with hundreds of layers.</mark>
    

#### **Common Layers**:

* **Conv2D**: Used for extracting features from images.
    
* **<mark>BatchNormalization</mark>**<mark>: Helps to stabilize the learning process by normalizing the inputs to each layer.</mark>
    
* **<mark>Add</mark>**<mark>: Implements the skip connection, which adds the input to the output of a layer.</mark>
    
* **Dense**: Fully connected layers for final classification.
    

---

### **Settings**:

* **<mark>Residual Block</mark>**<mark>: A combination of Conv2D, BatchNormalization, and the skip connection.</mark>
    
* **Filters**: Number of filters used in Conv2D layers (e.g., 64, 128).
    
* **Activation**: Typically `'relu'` for the hidden layers and `'softmax'` for the output layer.
    

---

### **Import Pattern**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Add, Dense, Input, Activation, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
```

---

### **Explanation**:

* **Residual Block**: Consists of two Conv2D layers with batch normalization, followed by a skip connection (the input is added to the output of the second Conv2D layer).
    
* **Add Layer**: Used to implement the skip connection, adding the input to the output of a layer.
    

---

### **Initialization**:

#### **Residual Block**:

```python
def residual_block(x, filters):
    skip = x
    x = Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)

    x = Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)

    # Add the input (skip connection) to the output
    x = Add()([x, skip])
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    return x
```

* `skip`: Stores the input for the skip connection.
    
* `Conv2D` + `BatchNormalization`: Extracts features and normalizes them.
