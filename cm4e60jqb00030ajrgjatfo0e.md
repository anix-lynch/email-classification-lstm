| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Active User Base (MAU)** | Monthly active users engaging with the open-source platform. | \&gt;100K | A large, engaged community supports long-term adoption and monetization. |
| **Freemium Conversion Rate** | Percentage of free users upgrading to paid plans. | 1-5% | Low conversion rates are normal, but freemium allows large user acquisition. |
| **Enterprise Revenue Share** | % of revenue from enterprise customers. | \&gt;70% | Enterprise clients drive the majority of revenue in this model. |
| **Retention Rate** | Percentage of paid users retained annually. | \&gt;90% | High retention ensures long-term revenue predictability. |
| **Gross Margin** | Revenue minus costs as a percentage of revenue. | \&gt;80% | High margins are typical due to low incremental costs for software delivery. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Monthly active users (MAU): 200,000
    
* Conversion rate to paid plans: 3%
    
* Enterprise revenue per client: $50,000/year
    
* Freemium users’ hosting cost: $1/user/year
    
* Paid users’ retention rate: 95%
    
* Marketing spend: $500,000/year
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Enterprise Clients × Revenue per Client`
        
    * Calculation: `(200,000 × 3%) × $50,000 = $3,000,000`
        
2. **Hosting Costs**:
    
    * Formula: `MAU × Hosting Cost`
        
    * Calculation: `200,000 × $1 = $200,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - Hosting Costs`
        
    * Calculation: `$3,000,000 - $200,000 = $2,800,000`
        
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue per Client × Retention Rate ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `$50,000 × 0.95 ÷ (1 - 0.95) = $950,000`
        
5. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
    
    * Formula: `Marketing Spend ÷ New Enterprise Clients`
        
    * Calculation: `$500,000 ÷ 6,000 = $83`
        
6. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ Revenue per Client`
        
    * Calculation: `$83 ÷ $50,000 = 0.0017 years (~0.6 days)`
