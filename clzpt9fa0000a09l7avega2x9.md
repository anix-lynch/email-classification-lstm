## **1\. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)**

Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique that involves creating multiple models using different samples of the data. By training each model on a unique subset, bagging reduces overfitting and enhances accuracy. The final predictions are made by aggregating the outputs of all models, typically through averaging or majority voting.

## **2\. Boosting**

Boosting is an iterative approach where each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models. This sequential focus allows boosting to enhance model performance over time. By giving more weight to the misclassified instances, boosting effectively reduces bias and improves accuracy.

## **3\. Random Forest**

Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees using bagging. Each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample of the data, and their predictions are averaged to produce the final output. This method is robust against overfitting and provides high accuracy, making it a popular choice for various machine learning tasks.

## **4\. Gradient Boosted Trees**

Similar to Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees utilize boosting instead of bagging. This method builds trees sequentially, with each tree focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor. The adaptive learning process allows Gradient Boosted Trees to achieve high accuracy and is particularly effective for complex datasets.

## **5\. Bias-Variance Tradeoff**

The bias-variance tradeoff is a critical concept in machine learning that describes the balance between bias (error due to overly simplistic models) and variance (error due to overly complex models). Ensemble methods like bagging and boosting help manage this tradeoff, providing a pathway to optimal model performance.

## **6\. Stacking**

Stacking is a more advanced ensemble technique that combines multiple models at different levels. In this approach, predictions from various base models are used as inputs to a meta-model, which learns to make the final prediction. This method leverages the strengths of diverse models, resulting in improved accuracy.

## **7\. Ensemble Learning**

At its core, ensemble learning is about combining diverse models to achieve enhanced decision-making. By integrating the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can provide more reliable and accurate results across various applications.
