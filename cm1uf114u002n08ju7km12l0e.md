### 1\. **Connecting to a Database** 🔌

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
```

**Use Case**: Connect to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to perform queries and operations.

**Goal**: Establish a connection to a database using SQLAlchemy’s `create_engine`. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write database connection logic and handle the low-level details of managing connections. 😕

```bash
Manual connection setup, error-prone and inconsistent across databases.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy’s `create_engine`, you can easily connect to any supported database with a single line of code. 🔌

```bash
$ python
# Output: Connection to SQLite database established successfully.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Connect to a different database system, like PostgreSQL or MySQL, and query data.

---

### 2\. **Defining a Table** 📝

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, MetaData, Table

metadata = MetaData()

users_table = Table(
    'users', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String),
    Column('age', Integer)
)
```

**Use Case**: Define the structure of a database table in Python code.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s ORM to define **tables** using `Table`, `Column`, and various data types. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, MetaData, Table

metadata = MetaData()

users_table = Table(
    'users', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String),
    Column('age', Integer)
)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually create tables using raw SQL, making it hard to maintain and scale. 😓

```bash
Creating tables manually using raw SQL queries.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, table schemas are defined in Python, and SQLAlchemy translates them into the corresponding SQL queries. 📝

```bash
$ python
# Output: Table "users" defined with columns for ID, name, and age.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Define a more complex table with additional data types like `DateTime`, `Boolean`, or `ForeignKey`.

---

### 3\. **Creating Tables in the Database** 🏗️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
metadata.create_all(engine)
```

**Use Case**: Automatically create tables in your connected database based on the defined schema.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s `create_all()` to generate tables based on your schema. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
metadata.create_all(engine)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually create tables using SQL commands in your database interface. 😕

```bash
Executing raw SQL to create tables, time-consuming and error-prone.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, tables are created automatically in the database based on your schema definition. 🏗️

```bash
$ python
# Output: Tables created in the database based on the defined schema.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Try creating multiple tables at once, including those with foreign key relationships.

---

### 4\. **Inserting Data** ➕

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
insert_stmt = users_table.insert().values(id=1, name="John", age=30)
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(insert_stmt)
```

**Use Case**: Insert new records into a database table.

**Goal**: Insert data using SQLAlchemy’s `insert()` method. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
insert_stmt = users_table.insert().values(id=1, name="John", age=30)
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(insert_stmt)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write SQL insert statements, which can be tedious and repetitive. 😕

```bash
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 30);
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, data is inserted in a programmatic way, and it’s easier to handle different databases. ➕

```bash
$ python
# Output: Data inserted into the users table.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Insert multiple rows at once using a loop or a bulk insert method.

---

### 5\. **Querying Data** 🕵️‍♂️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
select_stmt = users_table.select().where(users_table.c.name == 'John')
conn = engine.connect()
result = conn.execute(select_stmt)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Use Case**: Retrieve data from a database table.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s `select()` method to query data with conditions. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
select_stmt = users_table.select().where(users_table.c.name == 'John')
conn = engine.connect()
result = conn.execute(select_stmt)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Before Example**:  
You write raw SQL queries to retrieve data, which can be difficult to maintain for complex queries. 😕

```bash
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, queries are more readable and flexible, and they work across different database engines. 🕵️‍♂️

```bash
$ python
# Output: Retrieved data for the user "John".
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write a query that selects multiple users based on more complex conditions (e.g., age greater than 25).

---

### 6\. **Updating Data** ✍️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
update_stmt = users_table.update().where(users_table.c.id == 1).values(name='Jane')
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(update_stmt)
```

**Use Case**: Update existing data in a table.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s `update()` method to modify existing records. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
update_stmt = users_table.update().where(users_table.c.id == 1).values(name='Jane')
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(update_stmt)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write SQL update statements, which can become cumbersome for multiple fields or complex conditions. 😕

```bash
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane' WHERE id = 1;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, updates are more straightforward and consistent across different database systems. ✍️

```bash
$ python
# Output: User with ID 1 updated to have the name "Jane".
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Update multiple rows based on a range of values, and verify the changes.

---

### 7\. **Deleting Data** ❌

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
delete_stmt = users_table.delete().where(users_table.c.id == 1)
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(delete_stmt)
```

**Use Case**: Remove data from a table.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s `delete()` method to delete records based on conditions. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
delete_stmt = users_table.delete().where(users_table.c.id == 1)
conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(delete_stmt)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write SQL delete statements, which can be dangerous if not handled carefully. 😟

```bash
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, deletions are handled in a more controlled and flexible way. ❌

```bash
$ python
# Output: User with ID 1 deleted from the users table.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write a delete statement that removes records based on a more complex condition, like age or name.

---

### 8\. **Creating a Relationship (Foreign Keys)** 🔗

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey

posts_table = Table(
    'posts', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('user_id', Integer, ForeignKey('users.id')),
    Column('content', String)
)
```

**Use Case**: Establish relationships between tables using **foreign keys**.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy to define a relationship between tables via foreign keys. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey

posts_table = Table(
    'posts', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('user_id', Integer, ForeignKey('users.id')),
    Column('content', String)
)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write foreign key constraints using raw SQL, which can lead to errors. 😕

```bash
CREATE TABLE posts (id INTEGER, user_id INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id));
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, relationships between tables are handled seamlessly with the ORM. 🔗

```bash
$ python
# Output: Foreign key relationship created between users and posts tables.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Create a many-to-many relationship between two

continuing:

tables and implement the logic to query data from both.

---

### 9\. **Using ORM (Object Relational Mapper)** 🏛️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
```

**Use Case**: Map Python classes to database tables.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s ORM to represent tables as Python classes for easier query manipulation. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
```

**Before Example**:  
You write raw SQL queries to interact with database tables, making it harder to manage changes. 😓

```bash
Writing manual SQL queries for every interaction with tables.
```

**After Example**:  
With the ORM, you can query the database using Python objects, making it easier to manage your data model. 🏛️

```bash
$ python
# Output: User class defined and mapped to the users table.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write queries using SQLAlchemy’s ORM to insert, query, update, and delete data.

---

### 10\. **Querying with ORM** 🔍

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.query(User).filter(User.name == 'John').all()
```

**Use Case**: Retrieve records using SQLAlchemy’s ORM rather than raw SQL queries.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s ORM to query data using Python objects. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
users = session.query(User).filter(User.name == 'John').all()
for user in users:
    print(user.name)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write SQL queries to fetch data, which can become repetitive and difficult to maintain. 😓

```bash
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy’s ORM, you use simple Python expressions to query the database. 🔍

```bash
$ python
# Output: Retrieved users with the name "John".
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write a query using the ORM to retrieve users based on multiple conditions (e.g., name and age).

Here are the **SQLAlchemy** examples 11-20, following the **before-and-after** format for data science or machine learning projects:

---

### 11\. **Joining Tables** 🔗

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.query(User, Post).join(Post, User.id == Post.user_id).all()
```

**Use Case**: Retrieve data from multiple related tables using joins.

**Goal**: Use **SQLAlchemy's ORM** to perform SQL joins and retrieve data from related tables. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
session.query(User, Post).join(Post, User.id == Post.user_id).all()
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually write SQL queries for joins, which can be complex and hard to manage in large projects. 😕

```bash
SELECT * FROM users JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, you use Python objects to perform joins easily, making queries more intuitive. 🔗

```bash
$ python
# Output: Users and their posts retrieved via join.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Try joining three tables together (e.g., users, posts, comments) and fetching data from all of them.

---

### 12\. **Executing Raw SQL Queries** 🛠️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
result = engine.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Use Case**: Execute raw SQL queries when needed.

**Goal**: Use **SQLAlchemy** to run raw SQL queries when ORM abstractions are not enough. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
result = engine.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Before Example**:  
Sometimes, ORM queries don't cover all use cases, and you need raw SQL for more complex queries. 😕

```bash
Manually executing SQL outside of SQLAlchemy’s ORM framework.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, you can still execute raw SQL when needed, while leveraging ORM features for most operations. 🛠️

```bash
$ python
# Output: Raw SQL query executed, users retrieved.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write and execute a raw SQL query for complex joins, aggregations, or window functions.

---

### 13\. **Querying with Filters** 🔍

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.query(User).filter(User.age > 30).all()
```

**Use Case**: Filter data based on conditions using SQLAlchemy's ORM.

**Goal**: Use `filter()` to add conditions to your queries. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
users_over_30 = session.query(User).filter(User.age > 30).all()
for user in users_over_30:
    print(user.name)
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually construct SQL queries with WHERE clauses, making them prone to errors for large datasets. 😕

```bash
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy’s ORM, adding filters is straightforward and clean. 🔍

```bash
$ python
# Output: All users older than 30 retrieved.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write a query with multiple filters (e.g., users over 30 and living in a specific city).

---

### 14\. **Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)** 📊

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

session.query(func.count(User.id)).scalar()
```

**Use Case**: Perform SQL aggregations like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`.

**Goal**: Use **SQLAlchemy** to aggregate data with built-in SQL functions. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

user_count = session.query(func.count(User.id)).scalar()
print(f"Total users: {user_count}")
```

**Before Example**:  
Manually executing aggregation queries, which can lead to verbose code. 😕

```bash
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy’s `func`, you can easily perform aggregations in Python. 📊

```bash
$ python
# Output: Total users retrieved.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Perform other aggregations like `SUM` of user ages or `AVG` post likes.

---

### 15\. **Order By (Sorting)** 🗂️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.query(User).order_by(User.name).all()
```

**Use Case**: Sort query results by one or more columns.

**Goal**: Use SQLAlchemy’s `order_by()` to sort results. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
sorted_users = session.query(User).order_by(User.name).all()
for user in sorted_users:
    print(user.name)
```

**Before Example**:  
Sorting data with raw SQL can make queries verbose. 😕

```bash
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy’s ORM, you can easily sort results in a readable manner. 🗂️

```bash
$ python
# Output: Users sorted by name.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Sort by multiple columns, for example by age and name.

---

### 16\. **Limiting Results** 🔢

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.query(User).limit(5).all()
```

**Use Case**: Retrieve a specific number of records.

**Goal**: Use **limit()** to restrict the number of results returned by a query. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
limited_users = session.query(User).limit(5).all()
for user in limited_users:
    print(user.name)
```

**Before Example**:  
Manually handling pagination and limiting results in raw SQL. 😕

```bash
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, limiting results is easy and works across different database systems. 🔢

```bash
$ python
# Output: First 5 users retrieved.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Add `offset()` to your query to skip the first few results (for pagination).

---

### 17\. **Transactions (Commit/Rollback)** 🔄

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()
```

**Use Case**: Commit changes to the database or roll them back in case of failure.

**Goal**: Use **commit()** and **rollback()** to manage transactions. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
session.add(new_user)
try:
    session.commit()
except:
    session.rollback()
    raise
```

**Before Example**:  
You manually manage transactions and error handling, which can be tricky and error-prone. 😕

```bash
Manually writing commit and rollback logic with SQL.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy, transactions are handled cleanly with commit and rollback methods. 🔄

```bash
$ python
# Output: Data committed to the database, or rolled back on failure.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Write a test case that intentionally triggers an error and verify that the transaction is rolled back.

---

### 18\. **Using Sessions** 🗃️

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

**Use Case**: Manage database operations in an isolated session.

**Goal**: Use **SQLAlchemy sessions** to interact with the database within an isolated environment. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

**Before Example**:  
Manually managing multiple database connections and commits, which can lead to race conditions. 😕

```bash
Manually handling multiple connections in code.
```

**After Example**:  
With SQLAlchemy sessions, database operations are isolated and safely handled. 🗃️

```bash
$ python
# Output: Session created, ready for database operations.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Use multiple sessions to simulate concurrent database operations.

---

### 19\. **Eager Loading (Join Load)** ⚡

**Boilerplate Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

session.query(User).options(joinedload(User.posts)).all()
```

**Use Case**: Retrieve related data in a single query to avoid multiple database calls.

**Goal**: Use **eager loading** to improve query performance by joining related tables. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

users_with_posts = session.query(User).options(joinedload(User.posts)).all()
for user in users_with_posts:
    print(user.posts)
```

**Before Example**:  
You make separate database queries for each related record, resulting in slow performance. 😕

```bash
Multiple queries to retrieve users and their posts.
```

**After Example**:  
With **eager loading**, related data is fetched in one query, improving performance. ⚡

```bash
$ python
# Output: Users and their posts retrieved in a single query.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Implement eager loading for deeply nested relationships (e.g., users → posts → comments).

---

### 20\. **Lazy Loading (Deferred Load)** 💤

**Boilerplate Code**:

````python
session.query(User).all()  # No posts loaded yet
for user in users:
    print(user.posts)  #

It looks like we left off with **lazy loading** in SQLAlchemy. Let's finish **concept 20** and wrap up the **SQLAlchemy** examples 11-20!

---

### 20. **Lazy Loading (Deferred Load)** 💤

**Boilerplate Code**:
```python
session.query(User).all()  # No posts loaded yet
for user in users:
    print(user.posts)  # Posts are loaded when accessed
````

**Use Case**: Load related data only when it's accessed.

**Goal**: Use **lazy loading** to defer loading related data until it is needed, optimizing memory and performance. 🎯

**Sample Code**:

```python
users = session.query(User).all()  # Posts are not loaded yet
for user in users:
    print(user.posts)  # Posts loaded only when accessed
```

**Before Example**:  
You load all related records immediately, even if they are not needed, wasting memory and time. 😕

```bash
User data and their posts are all loaded at once, even if posts aren't used in the code.
```

**After Example**:  
With **lazy loading**, related data is loaded only when accessed, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency. 💤

```bash
$ python
# Output: Users loaded, and posts are only fetched when accessed.
```

**Challenge**: 🌟 Implement lazy loading for other related data, like comments or likes, and measure the performance difference.
