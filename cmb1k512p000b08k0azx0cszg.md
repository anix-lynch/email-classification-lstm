## 🗃️ **Storage & Formats**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Lake** | Big storage for raw data (e.g. S3) | Everyone dumps data in. Total chaos. | Created folders. Sent angry Slack about naming conventions. | Built a metadata catalog + validation layer early. | Auto-discoverable, tagged, queryable lake with access controls. |
| **Data Warehouse** | Fast storage for analytics (BigQuery etc) | Queries are slow, joins are messy. | Refactored SQL 4 times. Blamed BI team. | Modeled data into cleaned, documented marts. | Dashboards load in 2s, business trusts your tables. |
| **Partitioning** | Split table by columns like date | Query scans 300GB because… no partition. | Added a WHERE clause. Hoped no one noticed. | Partitioned by usage pattern from the start. | Queries only scan last 3 days. Costs drop 90%. |
| **Parquet** | Compressed columnar file | Columns nested deep. No one remembers schema. | Opened it in Pandas, guessed columns. | Stored schema in registry + added schema versioning. | Every analyst reads schema from a shared repo. |
| **Avro** | Streaming-friendly file format | Tools crash. Hard to inspect. | Wrote a Python script to read CLI output. | Used built-in schema evolution tools + unit tests. | Pipelines self-check schema drift and notify early. |
| **Delta Lake** | Versioned tables on the lake | You corrupted version 3. Restore fails. | Created a new table with `_v4_fixed_final_ok`. | Used time travel + checkpoints before big updates. | Teams rollback in one command. Audit logs trace every row. |
| **Z-Order** | Sorting trick to speed queries | You forgot. Queries scan too much. | Ran z-order job once. Never again. | Automated Z-order as part of ingestion pipeline. | Queries scan 10x less. Infra team sends you donuts. |
| **Compaction** | Merge tiny files into bigger ones | Table has 10,000 1KB files. | Scheduled compaction job. Forgot to monitor it. | Trigger compaction post-ingest based on file count/size. | Query latency low, S3 bill reduced, everyone claps. |

## 🏗️ **Foundations & Infrastructure**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ETL** | Extract → Transform → Load (classic pipeline) | Code works locally. Fails in prod due to timezone bug + NULLs. | Patched script. Added IFs everywhere. Scared to touch it now. | Modularized logic, added tests, set up logging. | Clean DAGs, tested transforms, alerts catch issues early. |
| **ELT** | Extract → Load → Transform (modern, SQL-based) | Loaded raw data. Transform SQL grew into 3000-line monster. | Added more CTEs. Wrote “DO\_NOT\_TOUCH.sql”. | Broke logic into dbt models with tests and docs. | SQL is modular, tested, documented. Everyone understands it. |
| **Batch** | Scheduled data job (e.g. nightly update) | Job failed silently over weekend. Monday = chaos. | Manually reran. Backfilled. Nobody knew why it failed. | Added retry logic, alerting, success markers. | Jobs fail loud, recover fast, business sees no disruption. |
| **Streaming** | Real-time data flow | Lag increases, metrics are wrong, business panics. | Restarted consumer. No idea what caused it. | Added consumer lag metrics, autoscaling, dead-letter queues. | Real-time stays real. Lag monitored, scaled, and alertable. |
| **Data Pipeline** | Chain of steps that move/clean data | One step fails silently. Data mismatch spreads. | Debugged for days. Hardcoded fixes. | Set up validation between steps + lineage tracking. | Pipelines validate each stage. Fail fast, fail traceably. |
| **Orchestration** | Tool that runs data jobs in order | Half of DAG runs. Other half “skipped” with no reason. | Re-ran the whole DAG. Again. Again. | Modular DAGs + failure alerts + retries. | DAGs are self-healing, observable, and track dependencies clearly. |
| **Airflow** | Scheduler for data pipelines | Scheduler down. No jobs ran. Nobody noticed until dashboard was empty. | Restarted webserver + scheduler + DB. Took 2 hours. | Health checks + alerting + containerized setup. | Airflow monitored, logs piped to dashboard, pagers ring early. |
| **Dagster** | Modern orchestration tool | Type check fails. Can’t deploy without guessing. | Changed types until it worked. Wrote TODO comments. | Added contract tests, used dev mode to validate before deploy. | Types guide dev, contracts validated in CI. Deployment is calm. |
| **Lakehouse** | Combo of warehouse + data lake | Query spans 5TB. Infra sends you a “friendly reminder” about cost. | Tried to optimize one giant table manually. | Created optimized delta tables with compaction + Z-order. | Queries fast, costs low, version control on data is standard. |
| **Ingestion** | Pulling data from source systems | Vendor changed API silently. Script crashed. No rows loaded. | Rewrote connector on deadline. Lost sleep. | Used connector library with schema checks + alerts. | Ingestions monitored, API changes caught early, retries work. |
| **Replication** | Copying data between systems | Replica DB out of sync. Nobody noticed until customer data was wrong. | Triggered full reload. Took all day. | Used checksum verification + alerts + row count diffs. | Replica always verified, discrepancies flagged automatically. |

## 🔄 **Data Movement & Messaging Tools**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Kafka** | Message bus for sending/receiving data streams | Consumer lag built up overnight. Metrics team found it first. | Restarted consumer. Deleted some offsets. Prayed. | Set up lag monitoring, autoscaling, dead-letter queue. | Streams scale on demand, lag auto-recovers, no data loss. |
| **Kinesis** | AWS’s streaming pipe (like Kafka) | Hit shard limit silently. Data slowed down. | Doubled shards. Burned money. Still had bottlenecks. | Planned shard scaling + enabled enhanced monitoring. | Shards autoscale, throttling alerts fire early. |
| **CDC** | Tracks DB changes (Change Data Capture) | Upstream schema changed. No PK. Downstream joins broke. | Repaired the broken ETL. Manually patched old rows. | Enforced schema contract, monitored for drift. | CDC handles change gracefully. Diffs tracked. Joins stay intact. |
| **Reverse ETL** | Push data from warehouse to tools (e.g. CRMs) | Sales team says “segment is wrong again.” Trust = 0. | Re-deployed transformations. Sent “should be fixed” Slack. | Wrote tests on business logic + versioned models. | Segments validated. Syncs monitored. Sales stops pinging. |
| **NiFi** | Drag-n-drop UI for moving data | Someone edited a flow live. It broke. Nobody owned it. | Diffted XML by hand. Rebuilt parts from memory. | Used versioned templates + Git-backed deployments. | Changes reviewed, tracked, auto-deploy from CI/CD. |
| **Flume** | Legacy log ingestion (Apache) | Logs randomly stopped ingesting. No one noticed for 2 days. | Migrated to custom Python Kafka script in panic. | Audited old systems. Planned phased deprecation. | Modern ingestion, observable, self-healing pipelines. |
| **Message Queue** | FIFO buffer to move data reliably | You forgot to `ack()`. Queue overflowed. Lost thousands of events. | Flushed queue. Wrote angry comment. | Used durable queues, retries, DLQs (dead letter queues). | Every message processed once, failure logged, nothing lost. |
| **Connector** | Plug-n-play tool to sync source → destination | Used free connector. It dropped 3 columns quietly. | Switched connector. Filed bug. Never got a reply. | Used tested + contract-enforced connectors. | Connectors monitored, version-controlled, testable before deploy. |

## 🧠 **Data Quality & Governance**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Contracts** | Agreement on what data should look like | Upstream team changed a column name. Broke everything downstream. | Added a hotfix. Sent passive-aggressive Slack message. | Set up schema validation + CI test on contract changes. | Schema changes versioned, validated, and auto-notified. |
| **Schema Drift** | When table structure changes unexpectedly | Your pipeline failed silently when column type switched. | Patched cast logic. Left TODO in code. | Added schema checks + alerts + column monitoring. | Schema issues caught instantly, stakeholders get diff reports. |
| **Data Lineage** | Trace where data came from and how it changed | Report wrong? No one knows where the number came from. | Manually traced 5 SQL layers back to raw logs. | Used lineage tools (like dbt or OpenLineage) early on. | Click a number → see its full origin path, version, and owner. |
| **Data Catalog** | Searchable index of all datasets | Team asks if “users\_2023\_final2” is safe to use. You have no clue. | Wrote a README. Nobody read it. | Tagged and documented datasets in a catalog tool. | Everyone can search, preview, and understand datasets before using. |
| **Profiling** | Scanning data to see stats (nulls, types, etc.) | Nulls spiked 2000% in one column. Report tanked. Nobody saw it coming. | Cleaned it manually. Didn’t check other columns. | Set up automated profiling reports on ingest + alert thresholds. | Data is self-scanned. Changes trigger alerts. Trust goes up. |
| **Great Expectations** | Tool to write tests on your data | 3 tests passed. 10 never ran due to a config typo. | Ignored the test logs. Filed under "check later". | Integrated data tests into CI + dashboards + PRs. | Tests run automatically. Failure = blocked deploy. |
| **Observability** | Knowing if your data is fresh, complete, accurate | Dashboard blank. No alert. You’re blamed in daily standup. | Added a “last updated” timestamp. | Tracked freshness, volume, anomalies with alerts + logging. | One dashboard shows pipeline health, freshness, and issue impact. |

## 📦 **Model & ML Pipeline Artifacts**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pickle** | Python’s way to save models | Model worked locally. In prod? Crashed with version mismatch. | Re-trained the model. Re-saved with “final\_final.pkl” | Logged version metadata + environment hash | Model versioned, reproducible, environment pinned |
| **Joblib** | Better way to save big models | Saved fine. Load time = 10 seconds. User already closed the app. | Increased memory. Added a loading spinner. | Quantized model + tested load speed | Load time &lt; 1 sec, optimized artifact, tested under load |
| **ONNX** | Format to move models between platforms | Converted from PyTorch. Accuracy dropped mysteriously. | Tried another conversion flag. Results still off. | Added conversion tests + precision checks | Accuracy guaranteed post-conversion. Works across tools flawlessly |
| **Model Registry** | Central place to store versions of models | Nobody knows which model is live. Slack thread = chaos. | Looked at file timestamps. Guessed. | Used registry with stage tagging (staging, prod) | One source of truth. Models tracked, promoted, and rollbackable |
| **Serialization** | Saving Python objects to disk | You saved an object. Then forgot what it was. File name: `temp123.pkl`. | Opened it in IPython and guessed. | Named + documented all artifacts + included schema refs | Everything saved is tagged, logged, and testable |
| **Metadata Tracking** | Storing info *about* the model | Lost which features were used. Rebuilt pipeline from scratch. | Guessed from training notebook. | Stored feature list + stats as JSON alongside model | Model comes with full config, feature set, metrics, and history |
| **MLflow** | Tool to track experiments, models, metrics | You ran 12 experiments. Don’t remember what changed between runs. | Repeated most of them. Labeled them “test1”, “test2”... | Logged params/metrics for every run + added tags | You can trace any result to code, data, model, and deployment stage |

## 📊 **Orchestration & Workflow Tools**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Airflow** | Scheduler for data pipelines | Scheduler crashed. Jobs silently skipped. Nobody noticed till CFO pinged. | Restarted scheduler. Manually ran missed tasks. | Set up health checks + retries + email/Slack alerts | DAGs self-heal, fail loudly, alert early |
| **Dagster** | Modern orchestration with types + context | Typed input failed due to timezone mismatch. Build blocked. | Relaxed types. Added a comment: “fix later.” | Wrote test scenarios for inputs + used dev mode for validation | Typed contracts enforce trust, test coverage blocks failure |
| **Prefect** | Pythonic orchestration with nicer UX | Cloud agent went down. Flows never ran. Dashboard showed green. | Kicked the agent. Restarted everything. | Monitored agents, logged flow state externally | Observability built in. Slack alert if a heartbeat fails |
| **Retry Logic** | Automatically retry failed tasks | Downstream API flaked. Whole pipeline died. | Retried manually with `rerun` button | Added exponential backoff retries with fail-safe | Transient issues resolve without human touching |
| **Backfilling** | Filling in old missed jobs | Stakeholder wanted last 90 days reprocessed. DAG exploded. | Backfilled in 10-day chunks. Cried when it crashed at 89. | Designed backfill-safe DAGs + chunk strategy | Backfill flows chunked, resumable, and parallelized |
| **Parameterization** | Running jobs with inputs (dates, IDs, etc.) | Missed a parameter default. Ran pipeline on wrong month. | Deleted bad data. Reran for correct params. | Enforced required param validation + CLI/GUI form options | Params validated, tested, and passed in consistently |
| **Cron** | Time-based scheduling | Timezone mismatch. Pipeline ran 1 hour late during DST. | Adjusted cron job. Missed window again in fall. | Used UTC + timezone-aware triggers | Schedules stable, regardless of daylight savings or region |

## 👤 **Stakeholder & Delivery Chaos**

| Term | Plain English | Real Drama 😵‍💫 | What You Did 🧯 | What You *Should* Have Done 🧠 | Ideal World 🌈 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stakeholder Requirements** | What the business team says they want | They said “just a simple report.” You built a dashboard with 12 joins. | Delivered late. Got “this isn’t quite what we meant.” | Asked for wireframes, examples, and KPIs before writing code. | Requirements = documented, signed off, testable |
| **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** | Promised freshness/performance | You promised hourly updates. Pipeline fails at 2AM. Found out at 10AM. | Backfilled data. Sent apology. | Set SLA alerts + fallback sources | Data always fresh within SLA. Stakeholders trust delivery |
| **Data Freshness** | How up-to-date the data is | Dashboard said “today.” Data was from last week. | Hid the timestamp. Updated when someone noticed. | Logged update timestamps, added freshness checks | Every dashboard shows last update time clearly |
| **Data Consistency** | Same logic = same results across teams | Sales sees different numbers than finance. Everyone blames you. | Rechecked SQL. Found 3 versions of the same logic. | Centralized logic in shared dbt models | Single source of truth. Logic is shared, versioned, testable |
| **KPI Misalignment** | Different teams have different definitions | "Active user" means something different to 3 teams. All charts disagree. | Created 3 versions of the same chart. Labeled them "Team A/B/C" | Held KPI alignment meetings. Defined metrics in shared docs | KPIs documented, blessed, and used consistently |
| **Unactionable Dashboards** | Looks nice, tells nothing useful | Stakeholders stare at it. Ask “what should I do with this?” | Added more charts. Made it worse. | Asked what decision the dashboard should support | Dashboard drives action. Fewer charts, clearer insight, tracked usage |
