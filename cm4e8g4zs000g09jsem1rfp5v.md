### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Monthly active users (MAU): 100M
    
* Ad impressions per user: 100/month
    
* Revenue per ad impression: $0.01
    
* Infrastructure cost per user: $0.50/month
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $5
    
* Retention rate: 90%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `MAU × Ad Impressions per User × Revenue per Ad`
        
    * Calculation: `100,000,000 × 100 × $0.01 = $100,000,000`
        
2. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly Revenue × 12`
        
    * Calculation: `$100,000,000 × 12 = $1,200,000,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Infrastructure Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$1,200,000,000 - ($0.50 × 100,000,000 × 12) = $600,000,000`
        
4. **CLTV**:
    
    * Formula: `(ARPU × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($12 × 0.90) ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $108`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `$5 ÷ $12 = 0.42 months (~13 days)`
