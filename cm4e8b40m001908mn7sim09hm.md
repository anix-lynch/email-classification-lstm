### **1\. Business Model Overview**

* **Description**: Data monetization involves generating revenue by selling access to proprietary data insights, analytics, or datasets. This can include direct data sales, API access, or embedding insights into products. Revenue streams are often subscription-based or pay-per-use.
    
* **Examples**:
    
    * **Palantir**: Sells AI-driven insights for government and enterprise applications.
        
    * **Experian**: Monetizes credit data and financial insights.
        
    * **Foursquare**: Provides location data to enterprises for market analytics.

### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Volume (TB)** | Total size of proprietary datasets available. | 10–100TB+ | Larger datasets increase monetization potential. |
| **Revenue per Data Transaction** | Average revenue generated per data sale or query. | $0.10–$10 | Varies by data granularity and exclusivity. |
| **Subscription Revenue Share** | Percentage of total revenue from subscriptions. | \&gt;50% | Indicates long-term recurring revenue stability. |
| **Data Query Latency** | Average response time for API queries. | &lt;100ms | Low latency is critical for real-time applications like trading or location. |
| **Retention Rate** | Percentage of customers retained annually. | \&gt;90% | Reflects data relevance and platform stickiness. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Total datasets available: 50TB
    
* Monthly data queries: 10 million
    
* Revenue per query: $0.05
    
* Infrastructure cost per query: $0.01
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $200
    
* Retention rate: 90%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly Queries × Revenue per Query`
        
    * Calculation: `10,000,000 × $0.05 = $500,000`
        
2. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly Revenue × 12`
        
    * Calculation: `$500,000 × 12 = $6,000,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Infrastructure Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$6,000,000 - ($0.01 × 10,000,000 × 12) = $4,800,000`
        
4. **CLTV**:
    
    * Formula: `(Revenue per Client × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($500 × 0.90) ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $4,500`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ Revenue per Client`
        
    * Calculation: `$200 ÷ $500 = 0.4 months`
