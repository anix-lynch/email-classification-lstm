AWS certification exams, especially the **Machine Learning Specialty**, often focus on recognizing **common combinations of services** in real-world scenarios. They love asking about how tools integrate, so spotting patterns in these combinations is key to success.

Letâ€™s distill the **mock exam patterns** into **common service combinations** likely to appear on the AWS MLS exam, with **typical scenarios**:

---

### **1\. Data Ingestion and Preparation Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **S3 + Glue + Athena** | "How would you query and transform data stored in S3 without moving it to another database?" |
| **Kinesis Data Streams + Lambda + S3** | "What services would you use to process real-time sensor data and store it in S3 for analysis?" |
| **Glue + Redshift + QuickSight** | "How do you clean data, store it in a data warehouse, and visualize it in a dashboard?" |
| **Glue Data Brew + S3** | "Which service allows a visual interface for cleaning and preparing data stored in S3 for ML workflows?" |

---

### **2\. Machine Learning Training and Deployment Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **SageMaker + S3** | "Where do you store training data for SageMaker jobs?" |
| **SageMaker + Glue** | "How would you preprocess large-scale data for SageMaker training?" |
| **SageMaker + Spot Instances** | "How can you reduce the cost of training large models in SageMaker?" |
| **SageMaker + Kinesis Data Streams** | "What service can feed real-time streaming data into a SageMaker endpoint for predictions?" |
| **SageMaker + SageMaker Neo** | "How do you optimize trained models for deployment on edge devices like IoT?" |

---

### **3\. Real-Time Prediction and Streaming Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Kinesis Data Streams + SageMaker Endpoints** | "How do you provide real-time predictions for a high-velocity data stream?" |
| **Kinesis Firehose + Lambda + SageMaker** | "How would you process incoming events and pass them to a deployed ML model for inference?" |
| **IoT Greengrass + SageMaker Neo** | "Which services would you use to deploy and run ML models on IoT edge devices?" |

---

### **4\. Analytics and Visualization Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **S3 + Athena + QuickSight** | "How can you query and visualize data stored in S3 without moving it to another storage layer?" |
| **Redshift + QuickSight** | "Which services would you use to create a business intelligence dashboard on a large dataset?" |
| **Glue + Redshift + SageMaker** | "How do you clean data, load it into a data warehouse, and use it to train an ML model?" |

---

### **5\. NLP and Document Processing Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Textract + Comprehend** | "How would you extract text from scanned documents and analyze sentiment or entities in the text?" |
| **Textract + Augmented AI** | "What service can add human review to document text extraction tasks?" |
| **Translate + SageMaker** | "How do you train an ML model for multilingual text classification?" |

---

### **6\. Cost Optimization Combos**

| **Combination** | **Pattern in Exam Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **SageMaker + Spot Instances** | "How do you save costs on SageMaker training jobs for large datasets?" |
| **Serverless Inference + SageMaker** | "Which inference option reduces costs for low-traffic ML applications?" |
| **Multi-Model Endpoints** | "How can you host multiple models on a single endpoint to reduce hosting costs?" |

---

### **How to Recognize These Patterns in the Exam**

1. **Look for the core task**: Is it training, inference, data cleaning, or visualization?
    
2. **Identify data flow**: Trace the input (e.g., real-time, batch, database) and match services accordingly.
    
3. **Spot cost or scalability concerns**: If the scenario mentions saving costs or scaling, think of services like **Spot Instances**, **Serverless**, or **Kinesis**.
