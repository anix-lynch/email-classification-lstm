### **1\. Business Model Overview**

* **Description**: Selling API access involves providing AI services via APIs, allowing businesses to integrate functionalities such as natural language processing, image recognition, or data analytics into their applications. Revenue is typically generated through subscription plans or pay-per-use pricing.
    
* **Companies**: OpenAI, Twilio, Cohere.

### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monthly API Requests** | The number of API calls made by customers each month. | &gt;10M requests | High usage reflects strong customer adoption. |
| **Revenue per API Call** | Average revenue generated per API call. | $0.001–$0.005 | Higher for specialized APIs, lower for commoditized ones. |
| **Enterprise Client Share** | Percentage of revenue from enterprise clients. | &gt;60% | Enterprise clients typically ensure stability and high contract value. |
| **Retention Rate** | Percentage of customers retained annually. | &gt;90% | High retention ensures predictable revenue streams. |
| **Gross Margins** | Revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). | &gt;85% | APIs have low marginal costs but may incur cloud infrastructure expenses. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Monthly API requests: 10 million
    
* Revenue per API request: $0.002
    
* Infrastructure cost per request (cloud compute): $0.0003
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $100,000/month
    
* Average revenue per user (ARPU): $2,500/month
    
* Retention rate: 95%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly API Requests × Revenue per API Request`
        
    * Calculation: `10,000,000 × $0.002 = $20,000`
        
2. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Infrastructure Cost × Requests)`
        
    * Calculation: `$20,000 - (10,000,000 × $0.0003) = $17,000`
        
3. **Gross Margin**:
    
    * Formula: `(Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100`
        
    * Calculation: `($17,000 ÷ $20,000) × 100 = 85%`
        
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `(ARPU × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($2,500 × 0.95) ÷ (1 - 0.95) = $47,500`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ Revenue per Client`
        
    * Calculation: `$100,000 ÷ $2,500 = 40 months`
