### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)** | Total value of transactions facilitated on the platform annually. | \&gt;$1B for large marketplaces | Higher GMV reflects strong platform activity and user trust. |
| **Take Rate** | Percentage of GMV retained as platform revenue. | 10%–25% | Indicates how effectively the platform monetizes transactions. |
| **Active User Base (MAU)** | Number of monthly active users on the platform. | \&gt;1M | A critical metric for scaling transaction volume and revenue. |
| **Conversion Rate** | Percentage of users who complete a transaction. | 5%–10% | Higher conversion rates indicate better user experience and engagement. |
| **Revenue Retention Rate** | Percentage of revenue retained from existing users year-over-year. | \&gt;85% | Ensures predictable growth and user stickiness. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* GMV: $1B
    
* Take rate: 15%
    
* Active users: 10M
    
* Conversion rate: 7%
    
* Average transaction size: $100
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $20
    
* Retention rate: 90%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `GMV × Take Rate`
        
    * Calculation: `$1,000,000,000 × 15% = $150,000,000`
        
2. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Operational Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$150,000,000 - $40,000,000 = $110,000,000`
        
3. **Revenue per Active User**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue ÷ Active Users`
        
    * Calculation: `$150,000,000 ÷ 10,000,000 = $15`
        
4. **CLTV**:
    
    * Formula: `(Revenue per User × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($15 × 0.90) ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $135`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ Revenue per User`
        
    * Calculation: `$20 ÷ $15 = 1.33 months`
