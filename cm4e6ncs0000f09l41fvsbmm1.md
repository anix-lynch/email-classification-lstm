### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Monthly active users (MAU): 50,000
    
* Conversion rate to paid plans: 5%
    
* Average revenue per user (ARPU): $50/month
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $500
    
* Retention rate: 90%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**:
    
    * Formula: `MAU × Conversion Rate × ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `50,000 × 5% × $50 = $125,000`
        
2. **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**:
    
    * Formula: `MRR × 12`
        
    * Calculation: `$125,000 × 12 = $1,500,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - COGS`
        
    * Calculation: `$1,500,000 - ($1,500,000 × 0.25) = $1,125,000`
        
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `ARPU × Retention Rate ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `$50 × 0.90 ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $450`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `$500 ÷ $50 = 10 months`
