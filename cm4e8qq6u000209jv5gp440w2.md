### **1\. Business Model Overview**

* **Description**: End-to-End AI Platforms (AI PaaS) offer comprehensive tools for building, deploying, and managing AI solutions. These platforms integrate infrastructure, model training, deployment, and monitoring into a unified service. Revenue is typically generated through usage-based pricing, subscription plans, or enterprise contracts.
    
* **Examples**:
    
    * **AWS Bedrock**: Provides pre-trained foundation models and deployment tools for businesses.
        
    * **Google Vertex AI**: Offers an integrated ecosystem for model training, deployment, and monitoring.
        
    * **Azure AI**: Combines cloud compute, AI tools, and APIs for enterprise-grade AI projects.

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Monthly active users (MAU): 10,000
    
* Average revenue per user (ARPU): $2,000/month
    
* Infrastructure cost per user: $700/month
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $10,000
    
* Retention rate: 90%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `MAU × ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `10,000 × $2,000 = $20,000,000`
        
2. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly Revenue × 12`
        
    * Calculation: `$20,000,000 × 12 = $240,000,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Infrastructure Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$240,000,000 - ($700 × 10,000 × 12) = $156,000,000`
        
4. **Gross Margin**:
    
    * Formula: `(Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100`
        
    * Calculation: `($156,000,000 ÷ $240,000,000) × 100 = 65%`
        
5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `(ARPU × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($24,000 × 0.90) ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $216,000`
        
6. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `$10,000 ÷ $24,000 = 0.42 months (~13 days)`
