### **1\. Business Model Overview**

* **Description**: AI-IaaS provides foundational services like compute power, model hosting, and infrastructure required to train, deploy, and scale AI systems. Monetization is typically based on usage (e.g., compute hours, storage, API calls) or subscription tiers.
    
* **Examples**:
    
    * **Nvidia**: Offers GPUs optimized for AI workloads and cloud services for model training.
        
    * **AWS (SageMaker)**: Provides end-to-end AI infrastructure for model building and deployment.
        
    * **Pinecone**: Specializes in vector databases for AI and machine learning applications.

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Compute hours billed: 1,000,000/year
    
* Revenue per compute hour: $2
    
* Infrastructure cost per compute hour: $0.80
    
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $5,000
    
* Average revenue per customer (ARPU): $50,000/year
    
* Retention rate: 95%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Compute Hours × Revenue per Compute Hour`
        
    * Calculation: `1,000,000 × $2 = $2,000,000`
        
2. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Infrastructure Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$2,000,000 - (1,000,000 × $0.80) = $1,200,000`
        
3. **Gross Margin**:
    
    * Formula: `(Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100`
        
    * Calculation: `($1,200,000 ÷ $2,000,000) × 100 = 60%`
        
4. **CLTV**:
    
    * Formula: `(ARPU × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `($50,000 × 0.95) ÷ (1 - 0.95) = $950,000`
        
5. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ ARPU`
        
    * Calculation: `$5,000 ÷ $50,000 = 0.1 years (~1.2 months)`
