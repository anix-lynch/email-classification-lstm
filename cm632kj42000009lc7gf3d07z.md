### **Explanation of Alice and Bob's Access**

In the example, **Row-Level Security (RLS)** ensures that users only see the rows in the `ksprojects` table where their `creator_id` matches their `current_user`. Hereâ€™s how it works for **Alice** and **Bob**:

---

### **Users and Access Rights**

* `creator_id`: Represents the ID of the user who created the project.
    
* `current_user`: Refers to the username of the currently logged-in user in the database.
    

---

### **Data in** `ksprojects` Table

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Smart Yoga Mat | Technology | 10000.00 | 1200.00 | live | 30 | 2024-01-15 | alice |
| 2 | Fitness Tracker | Technology | 15000.00 | 18000.00 | successful | 250 | 2024-03-10 | bob |
| 3 | VR Gaming Headset | Technology | 20000.00 | 25000.00 | failed | 500 | 2023-12-10 | alice |

---

### **Who Can Access What?**

#### 1\. **Access as Alice**:

* `SET ROLE alice;`: Sets the logged-in user to `alice`.
    
* The policy:
    
    ```sql
    USING (creator_id = current_user)
    ```
    
    allows Alice to see only the rows where `creator_id = 'alice'`.
    

#### **Result for Alice**:

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Smart Yoga Mat | Technology | 10000.00 | 1200.00 | live | 30 | 2024-01-15 | alice |
| 3 | VR Gaming Headset | Technology | 20000.00 | 25000.00 | failed | 500 | 2023-12-10 | alice |

---

#### 2\. **Access as Bob**:

* `SET ROLE bob;`: Sets the logged-in user to `bob`.
    
* The policy:
    
    ```sql
    USING (creator_id = current_user)
    ```
    
    allows Bob to see only the rows where `creator_id = 'bob'`.
    

#### **Result for Bob**:

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Fitness Tracker | Technology | 15000.00 | 18000.00 | successful | 250 | 2024-03-10 | bob |

---

### **Summary of Access**

| User | Rows Visible |
| --- | --- |
| Alice | Rows where `creator_id = 'alice'` (Projects 1 and 3) |
| Bob | Rows where `creator_id = 'bob'` (Project 2) |

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* **Alice** sees only her projects: `Smart Yoga Mat` and `VR Gaming Headset`.
    
* **Bob** sees only his project: `Fitness Tracker`.
    
* This is enforced by the **row-level security policy**, which ensures that users can only view their own data.

### **Row-Level Security with Kickstarter Projects**

**Question**: How can we implement a policy to restrict access to Kickstarter projects based on the `creator_id` and the currently logged-in user?

---

### **SQL Query**: Enable Row-Level Security and Create a Policy

```sql
-- Step 1: Enable Row-Level Security on the ksprojects table
ALTER TABLE ksprojects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Create a policy to allow only project creators to view their projects
CREATE POLICY project_creator_policy
ON ksprojects
FOR SELECT
USING (creator_id = current_user);
```

---

### **Explanation**:

1. `ALTER TABLE ksprojects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`:
    
    * Activates Row-Level Security (RLS) for the `ksprojects` table.
        
    * Ensures that access to rows is controlled by defined policies.
        
2. `CREATE POLICY project_creator_policy`:
    
    * Defines a policy named `project_creator_policy`.
        
    * Restricts `SELECT` access to rows where the `creator_id` matches the `current_user`.
        
3. `USING (creator_id = current_user)`:
    
    * The condition for the policy.
        
    * Grants access only to the rows where the `creator_id` column matches the username of the logged-in user.

### **Example Data in** `ksprojects` Table

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Smart Yoga Mat | Technology | 10000.00 | 1200.00 | live | 30 | 2024-01-15 | alice |
| 2 | Fitness Tracker | Technology | 15000.00 | 18000.00 | successful | 250 | 2024-03-10 | bob |
| 3 | VR Gaming Headset | Technology | 20000.00 | 25000.00 | failed | 500 | 2023-12-10 | alice |

---

### **Query Examples**

#### Query as `alice`:

```sql
SET ROLE alice;

SELECT * FROM ksprojects;
```

**Result**:

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Smart Yoga Mat | Technology | 10000.00 | 1200.00 | live | 30 | 2024-01-15 | alice |
| 3 | VR Gaming Headset | Technology | 20000.00 | 25000.00 | failed | 500 | 2023-12-10 | alice |

---

#### Query as `bob`:

```sql
SET ROLE bob;

SELECT * FROM ksprojects;
```

**Result**:

| Project ID | Name | Main Category | Goal | Pledged | State | Backers | Launch Date | Creator ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Fitness Tracker | Technology | 15000.00 | 18000.00 | successful | 250 | 2024-03-10 | bob |

### **Advantages of Row-Level Security**:

1. **Fine-Grained Access Control**:
    
    * Restricts data at the row level based on user identity or roles.
        
2. **Scalability**:
    
    * Automatically applies to all queries, reducing the need for complex application logic.
        
3. **Data Security**:
    
    * Ensures that users can only access rows they are authorized to see.
