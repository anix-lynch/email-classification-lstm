### **1\. Business Model Overview**

* **Description**: Token-based models leverage blockchain technology to provide AI services through tokenized ecosystems. Users purchase or earn tokens to access services, contribute to the network, or incentivize participation in decentralized AI marketplaces.
    
* **Companies**: SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, [Fetch.AI](http://Fetch.AI).

### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Token Circulation** | Total tokens actively used in transactions. | &gt;70% of total supply | High circulation reflects active usage and demand. |
| **Transaction Volume** | Total value of transactions on the platform (monthly). | $10M–$50M+ | High volume indicates strong platform activity and token utility. |
| **Token Price Volatility** | Measure of token price fluctuations over time. | &lt;20% monthly | Lower volatility increases token trustworthiness for business use. |
| **Platform Adoption Rate** | Growth in active users or developers using the platform. | &gt;20% annual | Indicates the success of onboarding strategies and utility demand. |
| **Revenue from Transactions** | Platform revenue from transaction fees or token sales. | 1%–5% of transaction value | Reflects the ability to monetize network activity. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Token price: $5
    
* Monthly active transactions: 100,000
    
* Average transaction size: $100
    
* Platform fee: 2%
    
* Development cost: $1M/year
    
* Retention rate: 80%
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Monthly Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Transactions × Average Transaction Size × Platform Fee`
        
    * Calculation: `100,000 × $100 × 2% = $200,000`
        
2. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Monthly Revenue × 12`
        
    * Calculation: `$200,000 × 12 = $2,400,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - Development Cost`
        
    * Calculation: `$2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000`
        
4. **Gross Margin**:
    
    * Formula: `(Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100`
        
    * Calculation: `($1,400,000 ÷ $2,400,000) × 100 = 58.33%`
        
5. **Token Demand**:
    
    * Formula: `Transactions × Token Price`
        
    * Calculation: `100,000 × $5 = $500,000`
        
6. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `Development Cost ÷ Annual Revenue`
        
    * Calculation: `$1,000,000 ÷ $2,400,000 = 0.42 years (~5 months)`

### **5\. Key Insights from the Model**

1. **Strengths**:
    
    * **Decentralized Scalability**: Tokenized models scale with network effects and community participation.
        
    * **Recurring Revenue**: Transaction fees create a steady revenue stream proportional to platform usage.
        
    * **Low Marginal Costs**: Once developed, decentralized platforms require minimal ongoing costs.
        
2. **Challenges**:
    
    * **Volatility Risks**: Token price volatility can discourage enterprise adoption.
        
    * **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating global regulations on blockchain and AI can be complex.
        
3. **Opportunities**:
    
    * **Enterprise Integration**: Providing stablecoins or hedging mechanisms for enterprises can drive adoption.
        
    * **Network Growth Incentives**: Rewarding developers or users for participation increases utility and demand.
