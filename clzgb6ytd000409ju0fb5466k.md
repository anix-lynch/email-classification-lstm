# 1\. Dependent/Independent variables

magine you are a fashion designer trying to understand what influences the popularity of your clothing designs. In this scenario:

<mark>Dependent Variable</mark>: Imagine the popularity of your clothing designs is like the "outfit popularity score." This score represents how well-received each design is among your customers. It's the outcome you're trying to predict or understand, much like how a house's price is determined by various factors.

For example, your "outfit <mark>popularity score</mark>" might range from 1 to 100, where 100 is the most popular.

<mark>Independent Variables: </mark> These are the factors that might influence the popularity of your designs. Imagine you're considering:

1. <mark>Color Brightness</mark>: How vibrant or muted the colors are (scale of 1-10)
    
2. <mark>Fabric Comfort</mark>: How comfortable the fabric feels (scale of 1-10)
    
3. <mark>Trendiness</mark>: How closely the design follows current fashion trends (scale of 1-10)
    
4. <mark>Price:</mark> The cost of the outfit
    

These factors are like the size and location in the house price example. They're the characteristics you can control or measure, which might affect the popularity (dependent variable) of your designs.

In a fashion analysis, you might use these independent variables to predict or understand the dependent variable (outfit popularity score). For instance:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example data: outfit characteristics and popularity
data = {
    'color_brightness': [7, 5, 8, 3, 6],
    'fabric_comfort': [8, 6, 9, 7, 5],
    'trendiness': [9, 7, 8, 6, 8],
    'price': [100, 80, 120, 90, 110],
    'popularity_score': [85, 70, 90, 65, 75]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Independent variables
X = df[['color_brightness', 'fabric_comfort', 'trendiness', 'price']]
# Dependent variable
y = df['popularity_score']

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Print the model parameters
print("Model Coefficients:")
for feature, coef in zip(X.columns, model.coef_):
    print(f"{feature}: {coef}")

print(f"\nIntercept: {model.intercept_}")
```

This analysis helps you understand how each factor (independent variable) affects the popularity (dependent variable) of your designs. For example, you might find that fabric comfort has a strong positive influence on popularity, while price has a negative influence. This insight can guide your future design decisions to create more popular outfits.  

# 2.Covariance vs Correlation

  
Now Imagine you're a fashion designer analyzing the relationship between different aspects of your outfits. You're particularly interested in how the brightness of colors and the comfort of fabrics relate to each other across your designs.

Covariance: Covariance measures <mark>how two variables change together</mark>. In your fashion world, it's like observing if brighter colors tend to be used with more comfortable fabrics, or if there's any pattern in how these two features change across your designs.

Correlation: Correlation is a standardized measure of <mark>how strongly two variables are related.</mark> In your fashion analysis, it tells you not just if color brightness and fabric comfort change together, but how consistently and strongly they're linked across all your designs.

Let's adjust the code to fit this fashion analogy:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data: color brightness and fabric comfort for different outfits
data = {
    'color_brightness': [7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9, 4, 7, 5, 8],
    'fabric_comfort': [8, 6, 9, 5, 7, 10, 6, 8, 7, 9]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate covariance matrix
cov_matrix = np.cov(df['color_brightness'], df['fabric_comfort'])

print("Covariance Matrix:")
print(cov_matrix)

# Calculate covariance value
cov_value = cov_matrix[0, 1]
print(f"Covariance between color brightness and fabric comfort: {cov_value}")

# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr()

print("\nCorrelation Matrix:")
print(corr_matrix)

# Calculate correlation value
corr_value = df['color_brightness'].corr(df['fabric_comfort'])
print(f"Correlation between color brightness and fabric comfort: {corr_value}")

# Visualize the relationship
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['color_brightness'], df['fabric_comfort'])
plt.xlabel('Color Brightness')
plt.ylabel('Fabric Comfort')
plt.title('Relationship between Color Brightness and Fabric Comfort')
plt.show()
```

In this fashion context:

1. Covariance: <mark>A positive covariance </mark> would suggest that as you use brighter colors, you tend to use more comfortable fabrics. A negative covariance would suggest the opposite - brighter colors tend to be paired with less comfortable fabrics.
    
2. Correlation: <mark>The correlation value ranges from -1 to 1. A value close to 1 would indicate a strong positive relationship</mark> (brighter colors consistently paired with more comfortable fabrics), while a value close to -1 would indicate a strong negative relationship. A value near 0 suggests little to no consistent relationship.
