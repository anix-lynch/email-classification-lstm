## 🧠 Why I Built This

I’m the kind of dev who prefers working smart over working hard.  
If I can offload a task to AI or automation, I will. So I asked myself:

> "Can I make Claude generate a to-do list, post it to Trello, and log it to Notion — all from a single CLI script?"

Answer: **YES. With LangGraph.**

---

## 🔧 What Is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a **Python-based DAG engine** for building structured workflows with LLMs (like Claude or OpenAI). Think of it like:

* 🧱 Zapier = For no-code tool chains
    
* 🔗 LangGraph = For **AI-driven task chains**
    

You define the **flow**, LangGraph keeps it clean.

## 🗺️ What We’re Building

A CLI agent that does:

1. 🧠 Ask Claude to generate a to-do list
    
2. 📌 Post each task to Trello as a card
    
3. 📓 Backup tasks to Notion with a tag
    

All wrapped in a clean LangGraph flow.

## 🐍 Full Python Code

```python
# pip install langgraph requests

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
import requests

# --- Step 1: Claude Node ---
def generate_todo(state):
    # Simulated Claude Desktop or Claude API response
    todo_list = [
        "Buy domain",
        "Set up GitHub Pages",
        "Push portfolio site",
        "Share on LinkedIn"
    ]
    print("🧠 Claude says:", todo_list)
    return {"todo": todo_list}

# --- Step 2: Trello Node ---
def send_to_trello(state):
    todo_list = state["todo"]
    for task in todo_list:
        print(f"📌 [Trello] Posting task: {task}")
        # requests.post("https://api.trello.com/1/cards", data={...})
    return state

# --- Step 3: Notion Node ---
def send_to_notion(state):
    todo_list = state["todo"]
    for task in todo_list:
        print(f"📓 [Notion] Logging task with tag #launch: {task}")
        # requests.post("https://api.notion.com/v1/pages", json={...})
    return state

# --- LangGraph DAG Flow ---
graph = StateGraph()

graph.add_node("generate_todo", generate_todo)
graph.add_node("send_to_trello", send_to_trello)
graph.add_node("send_to_notion", send_to_notion)

graph.set_entry_point("generate_todo")
graph.add_edge("generate_todo", "send_to_trello")
graph.add_edge("generate_todo", "send_to_notion")

app = graph.compile()

# --- Run It ---
print("🚀 Running LangGraph Workflow...\n")
app.invoke({})
```

---

## 📊 Why LangGraph?

This flow would’ve been a mess with plain `if/else` and repeated API code.  
LangGraph gives you:

* 🔄 **Branching** without chaos
    
* 🧠 Seamless Claude integration
    
* 📦 Clean, modular CLI automations
    

---

## 🛠️ Bonus Ideas

* Use Claude Desktop + MCP to auto-generate the `todo_list`
    
* Replace Trello/Notion print statements with real `requests.post()` calls
    
* Schedule this as a daily `cron` job to keep your day productive

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

LangGraph is the **AI task manager** I didn’t know I needed.  
It’s a programmable Zapier — but smarter, and more fun for devs.

Want to run Claude-powered pipelines from your terminal?
