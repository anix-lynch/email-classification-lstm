### **Example Savings**

Let’s assume:

* Your database processes **10M rows daily** with poorly optimized queries.
    
* After optimization, you reduce query execution time by **70%** and storage size by **30%**.
    
* **Before Optimization**:
    
    * Query Cost: $1,000/month
        
    * Storage Cost: $300/month
        
    * Total: $1,300/month
        
* **After Optimization**:
    
    * Query Cost: $300/month (70% reduction)
        
    * Storage Cost: $210/month (30% reduction)
        
    * **Total: $510/month**

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT sales.product_name, categories.category_name
FROM sales
JOIN categories ON sales.category_id = categories.category_id;
```

* **What Happens**: The database performs a **full table scan** on both `sales` and `categories`, comparing each row to find matches.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **category\_name** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | Fitness |
| Lipstick | Beauty |
| Dumbbells | Fitness |
| Perfume | Beauty |

| --- | --- |
| 1 | 20.00 |
| 2 | 15.50 |
| 3 | 25.00 |
| 4 | 45.00 |
| 5 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name,
       (SELECT SUM(quantity * price_per_unit)
        FROM sales_details
        WHERE sales.sale_id = sales_details.sale_id) AS total_revenue
FROM sales;
```

* **What Happens**: For every row in `sales`, the subquery is executed separately to calculate the revenue. This leads to **repeated scans** of `sales_details`.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 |

| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-01-03 | 10.00 |

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-01-03'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**: Fetches **only the required columns and rows**, with filters applied to the `order_date` and aggregation for `total_revenue`.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 |

| 10,000,000 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-12-31 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: The query scans the **entire table**, processing all rows, even if most rows don’t match the date range.
    
* **Output**: Correct result, but performance is poor due to the lack of partitioning.
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 1,000,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 500,000.00 |
| ... | ... |

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
-- Create partitioned table
CREATE TABLE sales_partitioned (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    order_date DATE,
    price_per_unit NUMERIC
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q1 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q2 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q3 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-07-01') TO ('2024-10-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q4 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-10-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- Query with partition pruning
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_partitioned
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-03-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The database only scans the **relevant partition** (`sales_2024_q1`), drastically reducing the rows processed.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 200,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 100,000.00 |

---

| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-01-03 | 10.00 |

#### **categories Table**:

| **category\_id** | **category\_name** |
| --- | --- |
| 101 | Fitness |
| 102 | Beauty |

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT sales.product_name, 
       categories.category_name, 
       SUM(sales.quantity * sales.price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
JOIN categories ON sales.category_id = categories.category_id
JOIN categories AS duplicate_categories ON sales.category_id = duplicate_categories.category_id
GROUP BY sales.product_name, categories.category_name;
```

* **What Happens**: The unnecessary second join to `categories` (`duplicate_categories`) creates redundant data scans. Aggregation across these redundant rows increases query complexity and execution time.

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
SELECT sales.product_name, 
       categories.category_name, 
       SUM(sales.quantity * sales.price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
JOIN categories ON sales.category_id = categories.category_id
GROUP BY sales.product_name, categories.category_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The redundant join is eliminated, reducing query complexity and execution time.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **category\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- | --- |

Here’s the explanation for **missing indexes or over-indexing**, including **metrics** and **impact**:

---

### **7\. Missing Indexes or Over-Indexing**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table**:

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **order\_date** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 2024-01-01 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 2024-01-02 | 15.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 2024-01-01 | 25.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 45.00 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-01-03 | 10.00 |

---

### **Case 1: Missing Indexes**

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-01-31';
```

* **What Happens**: The database performs a **full table scan**, checking each row in `sales` to filter by `order_date`.
    
* **Output**: The query is slow, especially for large datasets (e.g., millions of rows).
    

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON sales(order_date);

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-01-31';
```

* **What Happens Now**: The database uses the **index** to quickly locate rows in the specified date range.
    
* **Output**: Query execution is much faster for the same result.
    

**Metrics**:

* **Query Execution Time**: Improved significantly by adding a relevant index.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced query execution time by **80%** for large tables.
    
* 📉 Improved performance for filtering operations on **time-sensitive data**.
    

---

### **Case 2: Over-Indexing**

CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON sales(product_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON sales(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_category_id ON sales(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quantity ON sales(quantity);
```

* **What Happens**: Too many indexes increase overhead for write operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, as the database must update all relevant indexes whenever a row is modified.
    
* **Output**: Write performance becomes slower, especially for tables with frequent updates or high transaction volume.
    

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON sales(order_date);

-- Only keep essential indexes based on query patterns.
```

* **What Happens Now**: Only the necessary indexes remain, balancing query performance and write speed.
    

**Metrics**:

* **Index Efficiency**: Achieved balance between query speed and write performance.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced index update overhead, improving write operations by **50%**.

# **9\. Overly Complex Logic That Could Be Pre-Computed**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table**:

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **order\_date** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 2024-01-01 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 2024-01-02 | 15.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 2024-01-01 | 25.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 45.00 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-01-03 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue, 
       AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity, 
       MAX(price_per_unit) AS max_price
FROM sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: Every time this query is executed, the database performs **complex aggregations** (SUM, AVG, MAX) on a large dataset, even if the data hasn’t changed.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **avg\_quantity** | **max\_price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 3 | 20.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 5 | 15.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 2 | 25.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 1 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 7 | 10.00 |

**Fixed Code**:

1. **Pre-Compute Results Using a Materialized View**:
    

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue, 
       AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity, 
       MAX(price_per_unit) AS max_price
FROM sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

2. **Query the Materialized View Instead**:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The aggregation logic is pre-computed and stored in the `sales_summary` materialized view. Queries only read the pre-aggregated results.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **avg\_quantity** | **max\_price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 3 | 20.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 5 | 15.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 2 | 25.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 1 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 7 | 10.00 |

---

# **10\. Redundant Subqueries**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table**:

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 25.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 45.00 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       (SELECT SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) FROM sales AS s WHERE s.product_name = sales.product_name) AS total_revenue,
       (SELECT MAX(price_per_unit) FROM sales AS s WHERE s.product_name = sales.product_name) AS max_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: The subquery for `total_revenue` and `max_price` is executed **repeatedly for each row**, leading to unnecessary computational overhead.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **max\_price** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 20.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 15.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 25.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 10.00 |

---

**Fixed Code**:

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue,
       MAX(price_per_unit) AS max_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The subqueries are removed, and aggregations are performed directly in a single query using `GROUP BY`.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **max\_price** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 20.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 15.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 25.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 10.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Query Execution Time**: Eliminated repeated subquery execution for faster results.
    
* **Query Complexity**: Simplified logic by using direct aggregations.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced execution time by **85%** (subqueries removed).
    
* ⚡ Improved performance for datasets with **1M+ rows**, making operations scalable.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Subqueries executed repeatedly for each row in the outer query result in redundant computations and slow performance.
    
* **Solution**: Combine aggregations and calculations into a single query using `GROUP BY` or `JOIN`.

# **11\. Poor Data Validation During Ingestion**

**Demo Input**:

#### Raw Data (Before Ingestion):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | NULL | \-2 | 25.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | INVALID | 1 | INVALID |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code** (No Validation):

```sql
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_name, category_id, quantity, price_per_unit)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Yoga Mat', 101, 3, 20.00),
    (2, 'Lipstick', 102, 5, 15.50),
    (3, 'Dumbbells', NULL, -2, 25.00),
    (4, 'Perfume', 'INVALID', 1, 'INVALID'),
    (5, 'Jump Rope', 101, 7, 10.00);
```

* **What Happens**: Invalid data (e.g., NULL `category_id`, negative `quantity`, non-numeric `price_per_unit`) is ingested without validation. This leads to data quality issues during analysis.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | NULL | \-2 | 25.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | INVALID | 1 | INVALID |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 |

---

**Fixed Code** (With Validation):

1. **Add Constraints to the Table**:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0),
    price_per_unit NUMERIC CHECK (price_per_unit > 0)
);
```

2. **Validate Data Before Insertion**:
    

```sql
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_name, category_id, quantity, price_per_unit)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Yoga Mat', 101, 3, 20.00),
    (2, 'Lipstick', 102, 5, 15.50),
    (5, 'Jump Rope', 101, 7, 10.00);  -- Skipping invalid rows
```

* **What Happens Now**: Only valid rows are ingested into the table, preventing bad data from polluting the dataset.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Data Accuracy**: Improved by rejecting invalid data during ingestion.
    
* **Data Reduction**: Prevented bad data from increasing the dataset size unnecessarily.
    

**Impact**:

* ✅ Increased data quality by **95%**, ensuring accuracy for analysis.
    
* 🚫 Eliminated **100% of invalid rows** during ingestion.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Poor validation during data ingestion allows bad data (e.g., NULLs, invalid formats, negative values) into the database.
    
* **Solution**: Use constraints and pre-ingestion validation checks to maintain high-quality data.
    

Here’s the explanation for **redundant columns or duplicate records**, including **metrics** and **impact**:

### **12\. Redundant Columns or Duplicate Records**

**Demo Input**:

#### Raw Data (Before Cleanup):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **total\_price** | **sale\_id\_duplicate** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 60.00 | 1 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 77.50 | 2 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 25.00 | 50.00 | 3 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 45.00 | 45.00 | 4 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 | 70.00 | 5 |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 60.00 | 1 |

---

**Bad Code** (No Cleanup):

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales;
```

* **What Happens**: Redundant columns like `total_price` (can be derived as `quantity * price_per_unit`) and `sale_id_duplicate` increase storage size unnecessarily. Duplicate rows (e.g., Yoga Mat) further pollute the dataset.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **total\_price** | **sale\_id\_duplicate** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 60.00 | 1 |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 60.00 | 1 |

---

**Fixed Code**:

1. **Remove Redundant Columns**:
    

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales DROP COLUMN total_price;
ALTER TABLE sales DROP COLUMN sale_id_duplicate;
```

2. **Remove Duplicate Records**:
    

```sql
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE sale_id IN (
    SELECT sale_id
    FROM (
        SELECT sale_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY sale_id, product_name ORDER BY sale_id) AS row_num
        FROM sales
    ) t
    WHERE t.row_num > 1
);
```

3. **Calculate Derived Values in Queries**:
    

```sql
SELECT sale_id, 
       product_name, 
       category_id, 
       quantity, 
       price_per_unit, 
       (quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_price
FROM sales;
```

* **What Happens Now**: Redundant columns are removed, and duplicates are eliminated, reducing storage and improving data quality. Derived values are computed on demand.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **total\_price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 60.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 77.50 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 25.00 | 50.00 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 45.00 | 45.00 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 | 70.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Data Reduction**: Reduced dataset size by removing redundant columns and duplicate rows.
    
* **Data Accuracy**: Improved data integrity by eliminating duplicate records.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced storage requirements by **30%** (columns removed).
    
* 📉 Eliminated **100% of duplicate rows**, ensuring reliable analytics.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Redundant columns and duplicate records waste storage space and create inconsistencies in analysis.
    
* **Solution**: Remove redundant columns, eliminate duplicates, and compute derived values on demand.

# **13\. Live Queries on Large Datasets**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table** (Large Dataset):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **order\_date** | **price\_per\_unit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 2024-01-01 | 20.00 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 2024-01-02 | 15.50 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10,000,000 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 2024-12-31 | 10.00 |

---

**Bad Code** (Live Query Without Optimization):

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: The query scans the entire `sales` table (10M rows) to calculate `total_revenue` every time it is executed. This is resource-intensive and causes significant delays for live dashboards or reports.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 1,000,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 500,000.00 |
| Jump Rope | 700,000.00 |

* **Problem**: Even though the output is correct, the query time is unacceptably high for live dashboards.
    

---

**Fixed Code** (Use Pre-Computed Results):

1. **Create a Materialized View**:
    

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

2. **Query the Materialized View**:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
```

3. **Schedule Regular Refreshes**:
    

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The aggregation is pre-computed and stored in the `sales_summary` materialized view, making live queries instantaneous.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 1,000,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 500,000.00 |
| Jump Rope | 700,000.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Refresh Frequency**: Time taken to refresh pre-computed results periodically.
    
* **Query Execution Time**: Improved significantly for live queries by reducing on-demand computation.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced live query execution time by **90%** (10 seconds → 1 second).
    
* 📉 Improved scalability for **dashboards with frequent updates**, handling datasets with **10M+ rows** efficiently.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Live queries on large datasets are resource-intensive, leading to delays in dashboards or reports.
    
* **Solution**: Use materialized views or pre-computed tables to store aggregated results and refresh them periodically.

# **14\. Over-Reliance on Non-Optimized Dynamic Calculations**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table**:

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | 2 | 25.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | 1 | 45.00 | 2024-01-02 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 | 2024-01-03 |

---

**Bad Code** (Dynamic Calculations for Every Query):

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue,
       COUNT(*) AS total_sales,
       (SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) / COUNT(*)) AS avg_revenue_per_sale
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: For every query execution, the database recalculates `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `avg_revenue_per_sale` dynamically, scanning and processing all rows within the date range.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **total\_sales** | **avg\_revenue\_per\_sale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 1 | 60.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 1 | 77.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 1 | 50.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 1 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 1 | 70.00 |

* **Problem**: While the output is correct, dynamic calculations require repeated computations on the dataset, leading to slow performance, especially for large tables.
    

---

**Fixed Code** (Pre-Compute Metrics):

1. **Create Pre-Computed Aggregates Table**:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_metrics AS
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue,
       COUNT(*) AS total_sales,
       (SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) / COUNT(*)) AS avg_revenue_per_sale
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

2. **Query the Pre-Computed Table**:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_metrics;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The metrics are calculated once and stored in the `sales_metrics` table. Queries now fetch results from the pre-computed data instead of performing dynamic calculations.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** | **total\_sales** | **avg\_revenue\_per\_sale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 60.00 | 1 | 60.00 |
| Lipstick | 77.50 | 1 | 77.50 |
| Dumbbells | 50.00 | 1 | 50.00 |
| Perfume | 45.00 | 1 | 45.00 |
| Jump Rope | 70.00 | 1 | 70.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Pipeline Efficiency**: Reduced end-to-end query time for commonly requested metrics.
    
* **Query Execution Time**: Improved performance by storing pre-computed metrics.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced query time by **90%** for recurring metric calculations.
    
* ⚡ Enabled scalability for dashboards with **real-time updates** using pre-aggregated data.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Over-reliance on dynamic calculations wastes computational resources by performing repetitive operations.
    
* **Solution**: Pre-compute and store frequently used metrics in a dedicated table or materialized view.
    

Here’s the explanation for **missing values or inconsistent data entry**, including **metrics** and **impact**:

---

### **15\. Missing Values or Inconsistent Data Entry**

**Demo Input**:

#### Raw Data (Before Cleaning):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | NULL | \-2 | 25.00 | NULL |
| 4 | Perfume | INVALID | 1 | INVALID | 2024-01-02 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | NULL | 2024-01-03 |

---

**Bad Code** (No Validation or Cleaning):

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales;
```

* **What Happens**: Missing values in `category_id`, `price_per_unit`, and `order_date` remain in the dataset, along with inconsistent or invalid values (`INVALID`, negative `quantity`).
    
* **Output**:
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | NULL | \-2 | 25.00 | NULL |
| 4 | Perfume | INVALID | 1 | INVALID | 2024-01-02 |

---

**Fixed Code** (Cleaning Missing and Invalid Data):

1. **Handle Missing and Invalid Values**:
    

```sql
-- Replace NULLs with default values
UPDATE sales
SET category_id = 0
WHERE category_id IS NULL;

UPDATE sales
SET price_per_unit = 0
WHERE price_per_unit IS NULL;

-- Remove invalid rows
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE quantity <= 0 OR product_name = 'INVALID';
```

2. **Validate Data Before Insertion**:
    

```sql
-- Add constraints for validation
ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_quantity_positive CHECK (quantity > 0);

ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_price_positive CHECK (price_per_unit > 0);

ALTER TABLE sales
ALTER COLUMN order_date SET NOT NULL;
```

* **What Happens Now**: Missing values are replaced or removed, and invalid data is prevented from entering the dataset.
    
* **Output** (After Cleaning):
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 0.00 | 2024-01-03 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Data Accuracy**: Improved by replacing or removing missing and invalid values.
    
* **Data Reduction**: Eliminated invalid rows, reducing dataset size.
    

**Impact**:

* ✅ Increased data quality by **95%**, enabling reliable analytics.
    
* 🚫 Prevented **100% of invalid records** from entering the database.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Missing values and inconsistent data lead to errors and unreliable results during analysis.
    
* **Solution**: Use default values for missing entries, remove invalid rows, and enforce constraints for data integrity.
    

Here’s the explanation for **single-threaded processing or poorly optimized queries**, including **metrics** and **impact**:

---

# **17\. Single-Threaded Processing or Poorly Optimized Queries**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table** (Large Dataset):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10,000,000 | Jump Rope | 101 | 7 | 10.00 | 2024-12-31 |

---

**Bad Code** (Single-Threaded and Inefficient):

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens**: This query runs on a **single thread** and performs a **full table scan**, processing 10M+ rows on one core of the database server. The lack of partitioning or parallelization makes the query slow.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 1,000,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 500,000.00 |
| Jump Rope | 700,000.00 |

* **Problem**: The output is correct, but query execution time is unnecessarily high.
    

---

**Fixed Code** (Parallel Processing and Query Optimization):

1. **Enable Parallel Processing** (Database-Specific Setting):
    
    * For **PostgreSQL**, set the following configurations in `postgresql.conf`:
        
        ```bash
        max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4  # Adjust based on CPU cores
        parallel_setup_cost = 0.1           # Reduce setup cost for parallelism
        parallel_tuple_cost = 0.1          # Reduce tuple processing cost
        ```
        
2. **Use Table Partitioning**:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_partitioned (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit NUMERIC,
    order_date DATE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

-- Create partitions for each quarter
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q1 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q2 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q3 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-07-01') TO ('2024-10-01');
CREATE TABLE sales_2024_q4 PARTITION OF sales_partitioned FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-10-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

3. **Rewrite the Query to Use Partition Pruning**:
    

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_partitioned
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**: The database processes each partition in **parallel**, and query execution is distributed across multiple threads.
    
* **Output**:
    

| **product\_name** | **total\_revenue** |
| --- | --- |
| Yoga Mat | 1,000,000.00 |
| Lipstick | 500,000.00 |
| Jump Rope | 700,000.00 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Query Execution Time**: Drastically reduced by enabling parallel processing and optimizing data access.

# **18\. Storing Redundant Data or Using Inefficient Data Types**

**Demo Input**:

#### **sales Table** (Before Optimization):

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_id** | **category\_name** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | 101 | Fitness | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | 102 | Beauty | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |
| 3 | Dumbbells | 101 | Fitness | 2 | 25.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 4 | Perfume | 102 | Beauty | 1 | 45.00 | 2024-01-02 |
| 5 | Jump Rope | 101 | Fitness | 7 | 10.00 | 2024-01-03 |

---

### **Problems Identified**:

1. **Redundant Data**:
    
    * `category_name` is stored in the `sales` table, though it can be derived from a separate `categories` table using `category_id`.
        
    * This increases storage size unnecessarily and creates data consistency risks (e.g., typos or mismatches).
        
2. **Inefficient Data Types**:
    
    * `category_id` stored as an `INT` when the range of values (101, 102, etc.) fits into a smaller data type (`SMALLINT` or `TINYINT`).
        
    * `price_per_unit` stored as `FLOAT`, which can lead to precision issues for financial data.
        

---

**Bad Schema** (No Normalization, Inefficient Data Types):

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category_id INT,
    category_name VARCHAR(255), -- Redundant column
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,       -- Inefficient type for financial data
    order_date DATE
);
```

* **What Happens**:
    
    * Data redundancy increases storage requirements and risks inconsistencies.
        
    * Inefficient data types lead to wasted memory and precision errors.
        

---

**Fixed Schema** (Normalization and Efficient Data Types):

1. **Separate** `categories` Table:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    category_id SMALLINT PRIMARY KEY,  -- More storage-efficient type
    category_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO categories (category_id, category_name) VALUES
(101, 'Fitness'),
(102, 'Beauty');
```

2. **Optimize** `sales` Table:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category_id SMALLINT,             -- Smaller data type
    quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0), -- Validation to ensure positive values
    price_per_unit NUMERIC(10, 2),    -- Precise type for financial data
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(category_id)
);
```

3. **Query Data Using Joins**:
    

```sql
SELECT s.sale_id, s.product_name, c.category_name, s.quantity, s.price_per_unit, s.order_date
FROM sales s
JOIN categories c ON s.category_id = c.category_id;
```

* **What Happens Now**: Data is normalized, redundant columns are removed, and efficient data types are used.
    
* **Output** (Result of Query):
    

| **sale\_id** | **product\_name** | **category\_name** | **quantity** | **price\_per\_unit** | **order\_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yoga Mat | Fitness | 3 | 20.00 | 2024-01-01 |
| 2 | Lipstick | Beauty | 5 | 15.50 | 2024-01-02 |

---

**Metrics**:

* **Storage Optimization**: Reduced storage size by removing redundant columns and using smaller data types.
    
* **Data Accuracy**: Eliminated risks of inconsistencies due to redundant data.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced storage requirements by **30%** (e.g., redundant `category_name` column removed).
    
* 📉 Improved query performance by optimizing data retrieval using normalized tables.
    
* ✅ Increased precision in financial data with `NUMERIC(10, 2)`.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Storing redundant data and using inefficient data types waste storage and create consistency risks.
    
* **Solution**: Normalize the schema, remove redundant columns, and choose efficient data types tailored to the data range and precision requirements.

### **19\. Lack of Connection Pooling or Inefficient Query Design**

**Problem Overview**:

* **Connection pooling**: Re-using established database connections to handle multiple queries, rather than creating and tearing down connections for each request.
    
* **Inefficient query design**: Executing multiple queries where a single optimized query could suffice.
    

---

### **Example Scenario: Lack of Connection Pooling**

**Demo Input**: Imagine a web application processing 100 simultaneous requests to fetch sales data for specific products.

#### Inefficient Code (No Connection Pooling):

```python
import psycopg2

for request in requests:  # Simulating 100 user requests
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname="ecommerce", user="user", password="password", host="localhost"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) FROM sales WHERE product_name = %s GROUP BY product_name", (request["product_name"],))
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
```

* **What Happens**:
    
    * For every request, a new database connection is created and closed.
        
    * This increases overhead on both the client and the database server.
        
    * If connections exceed the database’s limits, queries fail or get queued, leading to poor performance.
        

---

**Fixed Code (Using Connection Pooling)**:

```python
from psycopg2.pool import SimpleConnectionPool

# Create a connection pool (shared by all requests)
connection_pool = SimpleConnectionPool(
    1, 20, dbname="ecommerce", user="user", password="password", host="localhost"
)

for request in requests:  # Simulating 100 user requests
    connection = connection_pool.getconn()  # Reuse pooled connections
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) FROM sales WHERE product_name = %s GROUP BY product_name", (request["product_name"],))
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    connection_pool.putconn(connection)  # Return the connection to the pool
```

* **What Happens Now**:
    
    * Connections are re-used, reducing the overhead of establishing and closing connections.
        
    * The application can handle more concurrent queries efficiently.
        
    * Query execution is faster and more reliable.
        

---

### **Example Scenario: Inefficient Query Design**

#### Inefficient Code:

```sql
-- Separate queries for each product
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM sales WHERE product_name = 'Yoga Mat';
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM sales WHERE product_name = 'Lipstick';
```

* **What Happens**: Each query scans the `sales` table independently, increasing the total query time.
    

#### Fixed Code:

```sql
-- Combine into a single query
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
WHERE product_name IN ('Yoga Mat', 'Lipstick')
GROUP BY product_name;
```

* **What Happens Now**:
    
    * A single query processes multiple products, reducing redundant scans of the `sales` table.
        
    * Improved performance by minimizing query overhead.
        

---

**Metrics**:

* **Query Execution Time**: Reduced by avoiding repeated table scans.
    
* **Connection Overhead**: Decreased by reusing connections through pooling.
    

**Impact**:

* 🚀 Reduced query execution time by **70%** for simultaneous requests.
    
* 📉 Improved system throughput by **50%**, enabling handling of **100+ concurrent requests** efficiently.
    

---

### Key Takeaway:

* **Problem**: Opening and closing database connections for every query leads to high overhead, while poorly designed queries result in redundant data processing.
    
* **Solution**: Use connection pooling for efficient connection management and optimize query design to minimize redundant operations.

### **1\. Reduce Query Execution Time**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Faster queries use fewer CPU cycles and memory.
        
    * In cloud-based databases like **AWS RDS**, **Google BigQuery**, or **Azure SQL**, you're often charged based on compute time and IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Use indexes for frequent queries.
        
    * Avoid redundant joins, subqueries, and full table scans.
        
    * Partition large tables to limit the scope of queries.
        

---

### **2\. Minimize Storage Costs**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Redundant data, inefficient data types, and poor schema design increase storage requirements.
        
    * Cloud providers charge for storage (e.g., **AWS S3**, **PostgreSQL on RDS**, **BigQuery**).
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Normalize tables to remove redundant data.
        
    * Use efficient data types (e.g., `SMALLINT` instead of `INT`, `NUMERIC` for precision).
        
    * Compress data where applicable.
        

---

### **3\. Optimize Concurrent Connections**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Excessive connections can cause throttling or increase server size requirements.
        
    * Providers may charge based on the database instance tier or number of concurrent queries.
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Use **connection pooling** to reduce the need for new connections.
        
    * Limit unnecessary or duplicate queries.
        

---

### **4\. Efficient Resource Scaling**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Poorly optimized queries may require a more powerful (and expensive) database instance or more memory.
        
    * Inefficient use of resources means higher-tier instances without added benefits.
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Tune database settings (e.g., parallelism, caching).
        
    * Use materialized views or pre-aggregated tables for recurring heavy queries.
        

---

### **5\. Reduce Data Transfer Costs**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Transferring unnecessary data between applications and the database can increase costs in cloud environments.
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Retrieve only the required columns and rows.
        
    * Use batch queries instead of multiple small queries.
        

---

### **6\. Improve Query Efficiency**

* **How It Saves Costs**:
    
    * Optimized queries require fewer reads, scans, and computations.
        
    * In systems like BigQuery, costs are based on the amount of data processed.
        
* **Optimizations That Help**:
    
    * Avoid querying unnecessary columns or unfiltered rows.
        
    * Design queries that aggregate data efficiently in the database.
        

---

### Key Takeaway:

Yes, SQL cost savings are a direct result of:

1. **Faster Queries**: Reduced CPU and memory usage.
    
2. **Efficient Storage**: Lower storage fees.
    
3. **Better Connection Management**: Fewer resources tied up.
