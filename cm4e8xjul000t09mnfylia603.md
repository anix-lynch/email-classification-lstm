### **Key Metrics Across AI Monetization Models**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Formula** | **Example Calculation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Average cost to acquire one paying customer. | `Total Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ Number of New Customers` | `$100,000 ÷ 1,000 = $100` |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | Total revenue expected from a customer over their lifetime. | `(ARPU × Retention Rate) ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)` | `($100 × 0.90) ÷ (1 - 0.90) = $900` |
| **Revenue per API Call** | Average revenue generated for each API call. | `Total API Revenue ÷ Total API Calls` | `$1,000,000 ÷ 500,000,000 = $0.002` |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | Total predictable revenue earned monthly from subscriptions or usage fees. | `Total Subscribers × Average Subscription Fee` | `10,000 × $50 = $500,000` |
| **Gross Profit Margin** | Percentage of revenue remaining after deducting cost of goods sold (COGS). | `(Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue × 100` | `($500,000 - $200,000) ÷ $500,000 × 100 = 60%` |
| **Usage Metrics** | Measures platform activity, such as API calls, storage used, or active users. | Examples: API Calls: `10 million calls/month`, Storage: `500 TB`, MAU: `1 million users` | N/A |
| **Conversion Rate** | Percentage of users converting from free to paid plans or completing a transaction. | `(Number of Paid Users ÷ Total Users) × 100` | `(10,000 ÷ 100,000) × 100 = 10%` |
| **Retention Rate** | Percentage of customers retained over a given period. | `(Number of Retained Customers ÷ Total Customers at Start) × 100` | `(9,000 ÷ 10,000) × 100 = 90%` |
| **Payback Period** | Time taken to recover the CAC through customer revenue. | `CAC ÷ ARPU` | `$100 ÷ $50 = 2 months` |
| **Annual Revenue Growth Rate** | Year-over-year percentage increase in revenue. | `((This Year's Revenue - Last Year's Revenue) ÷ Last Year's Revenue) × 100` | `(($2,000,000 - $1,500,000) ÷ $1,500,000) × 100 = 33%` |
| **Compute Utilization Rate** | Percentage of available compute capacity utilized by customers (AI Infrastructure). | `(Compute Hours Used ÷ Total Compute Capacity) × 100` | `(750,000 ÷ 1,000,000) × 100 = 75%` |
| **Revenue per Compute Hour** | Average revenue generated for each hour of compute usage (AI Infrastructure). | `Total Compute Revenue ÷ Total Compute Hours` | `$2,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = $2/hour` |
| **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)** | Total value of transactions facilitated on the platform (AI-Powered Marketplaces). | `Sum of All Transactions` | `$1 billion annually` |
| **Take Rate** | Percentage of GMV retained as platform revenue (AI-Powered Marketplaces). | `(Platform Revenue ÷ GMV) × 100` | `($200,000,000 ÷ $1,000,000,000) × 100 = 20%` |
| **Ad Revenue per User (ARPU)** | Average revenue generated per user through advertising (Ad-Supported AI Platforms). | `Total Ad Revenue ÷ Total Users` | `$12,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = $12` |
| **Retention Rate for Freemium** | Percentage of free users upgrading or staying on the platform annually. | `(Retained Freemium Users ÷ Total Freemium Users) × 100` | `(7,000 ÷ 10,000) × 100 = 70%` |
| **Hosting Costs** | Total cost to host and serve AI services (e.g., storage, compute). | `Cost per API Call × Total API Calls` | `$0.001 × 500,000,000 = $500,000` |
| **Time-to-Value (TTV)** | Average time for a user to deploy their first AI model or derive business value (End-to-End AI PaaS). | Time taken to deploy a functional model | `<1 month` |

### **Key Observations**

1. **Foundational Metrics**: CAC, LTV, and ARPU are critical across all models to assess profitability and scalability.
    
2. **Usage-Driven Metrics**: For API-based and infrastructure services, usage metrics (API calls, compute hours) are directly tied to revenue.
    
3. **Retention as a Driver**: High retention rates improve LTV, reduce churn, and lower CAC over time.
    
4. **Gross Margins**: High gross margins (&gt;50%) are typical in software-heavy models, while infrastructure-heavy models have lower margins.
    
5. **Scalability Indicators**: Metrics like GMV, take rate, and compute utilization highlight the scalability of platform-based models.
