### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Average Contract Value (ACV)** | The average annual value of enterprise licensing agreements. | $100K–$1M+ | Higher ACVs indicate strong enterprise adoption. |
| **Client Retention Rate** | Percentage of enterprise clients renewing annually. | \&gt;90% | Indicates the stickiness of the solution and client satisfaction. |
| **Custom Deployment Time** | Average time required for custom deployment of the solution. | 3–6 months | Shorter deployment times improve client onboarding and reduce churn risk. |
| **Revenue Per Employee** | Total revenue divided by the number of employees. | $200K–$500K | Reflects operational efficiency for high-touch enterprise businesses. |
| **Support Cost as % of Revenue** | Percentage of revenue spent on support and maintenance. | &lt;10% | Low costs highlight scalable support operations. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Enterprise clients: 50
    
* Average contract value (ACV): $200,000/year
    
* Deployment cost per client: $50,000
    
* Support cost per client: $20,000/year
    
* Retention rate: 95%
    
* Marketing spend: $1M/year
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Enterprise Clients × ACV`
        
    * Calculation: `50 × $200,000 = $10,000,000`
        
2. **Support Costs**:
    
    * Formula: `Clients × Support Cost per Client`
        
    * Calculation: `50 × $20,000 = $1,000,000`
        
3. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - (Deployment Costs + Support Costs)`
        
    * Calculation: `$10,000,000 - ($50,000 × 50 + $1,000,000) = $6,500,000`
        
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `ACV × Retention Rate ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `$200,000 × 0.95 ÷ (1 - 0.95) = $3,800,000`
        
5. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
    
    * Formula: `Marketing Spend ÷ New Enterprise Clients`
        
    * Calculation: `$1,000,000 ÷ 10 = $100,000`
        
6. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ ACV`
        
    * Calculation: `$100,000 ÷ $200,000 = 0.5 years (~6 months)`
