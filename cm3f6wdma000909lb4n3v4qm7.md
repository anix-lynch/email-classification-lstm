# NLTK/SPACY Code with sample output

### Chunk 1: Basic Tokenization with NLTK

1. **Code**: Tokenization is breaking down a sentence into individual words or symbols. Here, we use `nltk`, a popular Python library for natural language processing (NLP).
    
    * `word_tokenize()` function helps split the text into smaller pieces, known as tokens.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Importing the NLTK library and word tokenization function
    import nltk
    from nltk import word_tokenize  # Helps split sentences into individual words
    
    # Sample sentence for tokenization
    text = "we'd like to book a flight from boston to london"
    
    # Tokenizing the sentence
    tokenized_text = word_tokenize(text)
    print(tokenized_text)  # Outputs individual words and symbols in a list format
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    ['we', "'d", 'like', 'to', 'book', 'a', 'flight', 'from', 'boston', 'to', 'london']
    ```
    
    Here, each word (and punctuation) is separated into its own element in the list.
    

---

### Chunk 2: Frequency Distribution (FD) in NLTK

1. **Code**: Frequency Distribution (`FreqDist`) counts how often each word appears in the list of tokens, showing us which words are most common.
    
    * We use `FreqDist` from `nltk.probability`, which calculates word frequencies for a list of tokens.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Importing the Frequency Distribution module from nltk
    from nltk.probability import FreqDist
    
    # Creating a frequency distribution of tokens
    fdist = FreqDist(tokenized_text)
    print(fdist)  # Outputs the frequency distribution object
    print(fdist.most_common(3))  # Shows the top 3 most frequent words
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    <FreqDist with 10 samples and 10 outcomes>
    [('we', 1), ("'d", 1), ('like', 1)]
    ```
    
    * Each word in the sentence occurs once, so they all have a frequency of 1. This object allows you to see which words are most common and how often they appear.
        

---

### Chunk 3: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging in NLTK

1. **Code**: Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging assigns each word a role, like a noun or verb.
    
    * `nltk.pos_tag()` automatically assigns POS tags to each token.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Using nltk's pos_tag to assign parts of speech to each word in the tokenized text
    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokenized_text)
    print(pos_tags)  # Outputs a list of words with their corresponding POS tags
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [('we', 'PRP'), ("'d", 'MD'), ('like', 'VB'), ('to', 'TO'), ('book', 'VB'), 
     ('a', 'DT'), ('flight', 'NN'), ('from', 'IN'), ('boston', 'NN'), ('to', 'TO'), ('london', 'NN')]
    ```
    
    * Each token is followed by a POS tag (e.g., `PRP` for pronoun, `VB` for verb, `NN` for noun). This tells us the function of each word in the sentence.
        

---

### Chunk 4: Tokenization and Frequency Distribution with SpaCy

1. **Code**: We use `spacy` here, a different NLP library. SpaCy’s `nlp` model automatically tokenizes text, creates linguistic annotations, and more.
    
    * `spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')` loads a lightweight English language model for processing.
        
    * `Counter` from the `collections` module counts occurrences of each token.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    import spacy
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Load SpaCy's small English model
    nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
    
    # Define text and process it using the SpaCy model
    text = "we'd like to book a flight from boston to london"
    doc = nlp(text)  # Processes text into a spaCy document object
    
    # Extract tokens and calculate frequency distribution
    words = [token.text for token in doc]  # Tokenizes the text into words
    word_freq = Counter(words)  # Counts occurrences of each word
    print(word_freq)  # Shows word frequencies
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    Counter({"we'd": 1, 'like': 1, 'to': 2, 'book': 1, 'a': 1, 'flight': 1, 'from': 1, 'boston': 1, 'london': 1})
    ```
    
    * This output shows each word's frequency in the sentence. Unlike NLTK, SpaCy processes text into a `doc` object, which allows easy access to each token.

Great, let’s move on to the next chunks in a similar format.

---

### Chunk 5: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging with SpaCy

1. **Code**: Just like NLTK, SpaCy can also perform POS tagging. Each token in the `doc` object has a `.pos_` attribute, which gives the part of speech.
    
    * `token.text` extracts the actual word, while `token.pos_` shows the POS tag.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Perform POS tagging using SpaCy
    for token in doc:
        print(token.text, token.pos_)  # Prints each word with its part of speech
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    we'd PRON
    like VERB
    to PART
    book VERB
    a DET
    flight NOUN
    from ADP
    boston PROPN
    to PART
    london PROPN
    ```
    
    * Each token is followed by a simple part-of-speech tag (e.g., `PRON` for pronoun, `VERB` for verb, `NOUN` for noun, `PROPN` for proper noun). SpaCy’s POS tags are usually more human-readable.
        

---

### Chunk 6: Visualizing Entities with SpaCy’s displaCy

1. **Code**: `displacy.render()` is a SpaCy tool for visualizing the entities (like names, places) in the text.
    
    * `style='ent'` means entity visualization, and `options={'distance':200}` adjusts spacing.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    from spacy import displacy
    
    # Define new text and process it
    text = "we'd like to book a flight from boston to new york"
    doc = nlp(text)  # Re-processes text into a spaCy doc
    
    # Visualize entities with displaCy
    displacy.render(doc, style='ent', jupyter=True, options={'distance':200})
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    * This will show an interactive display in Jupyter with Boston and New York highlighted as places (entities).
        
    * **Note**: `displacy.render` requires Jupyter to show visualizations inline.
        

---

### Chunk 7: Visualizing Dependency Parsing with SpaCy’s displaCy

1. **Code**: Dependency parsing shows how words in a sentence relate to each other (subject, verb, object).
    
    * `style='dep'` specifies dependency visualization, which links words with arrows.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # New sentence to visualize
    doc = nlp("they get in an accident")
    
    # Visualize dependency parse tree
    displacy.render(doc, style='dep', jupyter=True, options={'distance':200})
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    * An interactive dependency tree with arrows indicating grammatical relationships, such as "they" (subject) linked to "get" (verb).
        
    * **Note**: Only displays correctly in Jupyter notebooks.
        

---

### Chunk 8: Downloading NLTK Datasets

1. **Code**: NLTK requires specific datasets, such as a token dictionary or movie review corpus.
    
    * [`nltk.download`](http://nltk.download)`()` opens a modal where you can choose which datasets to download.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Opens the NLTK downloader in a separate window
    nltk.download()
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    * This opens a new window to download datasets like `movie_reviews` or `stopwords`. Use it once to set up necessary resources for NLTK.
        

---

### Chunk 9: Importing and Exploring NLTK’s Movie Reviews Corpus

1. **Code**: The `movie_reviews` corpus in NLTK provides labeled sentences, useful for text analysis.
    
    * `sents()` returns sentences as lists of words, while `words()` returns a flat list of all words in the corpus.
        
2. **Code Explanation with Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Import the movie reviews corpus
    from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews
    
    # Retrieve all sentences
    sents = movie_reviews.sents()
    print(sents[:2])  # Display the first two sentences for a preview
    
    # Sample a single sentence
    sample = sents[9]
    print(sample)  # Outputs a list of words in a specific sentence
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [['plot', ':', 'two', 'teen', 'couples', 'go', 'to', 'a', 'church', 'party', ',', 'drink', 'and', 'then', 'drive', '.'],
     ['they', 'get', 'into', 'an', 'accident', '.']]
    ['they', 'seem', 'to', 'have', 'taken', 'this', 'pretty', 'neat', 'concept', ',', 'but', 'executed', 'it', 'terribly', '.']
    ```
    
    * Each sentence is a list of words and punctuation, ideal for word-level analysis.

    ```python
    # Importing required libraries for data manipulation and visualization
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Step 1: Get all words from the movie_reviews corpus using nltk
    words = movie_reviews.words()  # words() returns all words in the corpus as a list
    
    # Step 2: Create a frequency distribution for alphabetic words
    # Here, we use `word.lower()` to make all words lowercase (standardizing case) and
    # `isalpha()` to ensure only alphabetic words are counted (removes punctuation).
    word_counts = nltk.FreqDist(word.lower() for word in words if word.isalpha())
    
    # Step 3: Retrieve the top 25 most common words as a list of tuples
    top_words = word_counts.most_common(25)  # most_common(25) returns the top 25 word-frequency pairs
    
    # Step 4: Convert the word-frequency pairs into a Pandas Series for easy plotting
    all_fdist = pd.Series(dict(top_words))  # Convert the list of tuples into a Series for plotting
    
    # Step 5: Plotting
    # Set up the plot size
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
    
    # Create a bar plot using seaborn with word labels on x-axis and frequency on y-axis
    sns.barplot(x=all_fdist.index, y=all_fdist.values, ax=ax)  # ax=ax plots on the specified subplot
    plt.xticks(rotation=60)  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
    plt.title("Frequency -- Top 25 Words in the Movie Review Corpus", fontsize=18)
    plt.xlabel("Words", fontsize=14)
    plt.ylabel("Frequency", fontsize=14)

    * A bar chart displaying the 25 most common words in the movie review corpus, with labels like "the," "and," "of" along the x-axis and their frequency counts on the y-axis.
        

---

### Chunk 11: Generating a WordCloud for the Movie Review Corpus

1. **Explanation**: This chunk generates a WordCloud (visual representation of word frequencies) for the 25 most common words. The WordCloud uses the word frequency to determine the size of each word in the cloud.
    
    * **Modules/Classes Used**:
        
        * `WordCloud`: Generates a cloud image from word frequencies.
            
        * `matplotlib.pyplot`: Displays the generated WordCloud.
            
2. **Code with Detailed Inline Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Importing WordCloud from wordcloud library
    from wordcloud import WordCloud
    
    # Step 1: Generate the WordCloud based on word frequencies from `all_fdist`
    # - background_color='white' sets a white background
    # - max_words=25 limits the number of words displayed to 25
    # - colormap='Dark2' applies a color map for styling
    wordcloud = WordCloud(
        background_color='white',
        max_words=25,
        width=600,  # Width of the canvas
        height=300,  # Height of the canvas
        max_font_size=150,  # Sets the maximum font size
        colormap='Dark2'
    ).generate_from_frequencies(all_fdist)  # Generates the word cloud using word frequencies in `all_fdist`
    
    # Step 2: Display the WordCloud
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')  # Displays the image with smooth interpolation
    plt.axis("off")  # Hides the axis for a cleaner look
    plt.show()  # Renders the word cloud plot
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    * A WordCloud with the 25 most common words, where the size of each word represents its frequency. Common words like "the" or "and" appear larger in the cloud.

### Chunk 12: Part-of-Speech (POS) Frequency in the Movie Corpus

1. **Explanation**: This chunk counts the frequency of different parts of speech (POS) in the `movie_reviews` corpus. It uses `nltk.pos_tag_sents` to tag each word and `Counter` to count each POS tag.
    
    * **Modules/Classes Used**:
        
        * `nltk.pos_tag_sents`: Tags multiple sentences with POS at once.
            
        * `collections.Counter`: Counts the frequency of each POS.
            
        * `seaborn.barplot`: Visualizes the most common POS types.
            
        * `matplotlib.pyplot`: Manages plotting and customization.
            
2. **Code with Detailed Inline Comments**:
    
    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Retrieve sentences and POS-tag them
    movie_reviews_sentences = movie_reviews.sents()  # Returns all sentences as lists of words
    tagged_sentences = nltk.pos_tag_sents(movie_reviews_sentences)  # Tags each sentence's words with POS
    
    # Step 2: Initialize an empty Counter to aggregate POS frequencies
    total_counts = Counter()
    
    # Loop through each tagged sentence
    for sentence in tagged_sentences:
        # Count POS tags for each word in the sentence
        counts = Counter(tag for word, tag in sentence)
        # Update total_counts by adding counts for the current sentence
        total_counts.update(counts)
    
    # Step 3: Sort POS tags by frequency and select the top 18 tags
    sorted_tag_list = sorted(total_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)  # Sorts tags by frequency
    most_common_tags = pd.DataFrame(sorted_tag_list[:18])  # Converts top 18 POS tags to a DataFrame for plotting
    
    # Step 4: Plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))  # Set up figure and axes with size
    sns.barplot(x=most_common_tags[0], y=most_common_tags[1], ax=ax)  # Create barplot of POS frequency
    plt.xticks(rotation=70)  # Rotate labels for readability

### Chunk 13: Tokenizing and POS Tagging Multiple Sentences in NLTK

1. **Explanation**: This chunk shows how to tag multiple sentences at once, where each sentence is treated as a separate list of words.
    
    * **Modules/Classes Used**:
        
        * `nltk.pos_tag_sents`: Tags all sentences in one call, which is more efficient than tagging each sentence individually.
            
        * [`nltk.corpus.movie`](http://nltk.corpus.movie)`_reviews`: Provides example sentences.
            
2. **Code with Detailed Inline Comments**:
    
    ```python
    # Importing the required dataset from NLTK
    from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews
    
    # Step 1: Retrieve all sentences in the movie_reviews corpus
    sents = movie_reviews.sents()  # Each sentence is a list of words
    
    # Step 2: POS tagging all sentences using pos_tag_sents for efficiency
    tagged_sentences = nltk.pos_tag_sents(sents)  # Tags each sentence's words with POS
    
    # Step 3: Display a tagged sample sentence
    sample_tagged_sentence = tagged_sentences[9]  # Retrieve the 10th sentence with POS tags
    print(sample_tagged_sentence)  # Shows POS-tagged words for a single sentence
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [('they', 'PRP'), ('seem', 'VBP'), ('to', 'TO'), ('have', 'VB'), ('taken', 'VBN'), 
     ('this', 'DT'), ('pretty', 'RB'), ('neat', 'JJ'), ('concept', 'NN'), (',', ','), 
     ('but', 'CC'), ('executed', 'VBD'), ('it', 'PRP'), ('terribly', 'RB'), ('.', '.')]
    ```
    
    * Each word is followed by its POS tag (e.g., `PRP` for pronoun, `VB` for verb, etc.), showing the syntactic function of each word.

### Chunk 14: Advanced POS Frequency Analysis in NLTK

1. **Explanation**: This chunk calculates the frequency of each POS tag across all sentences, helping us analyze which POS types are most common.
    
    * **Modules/Classes Used**:
        
        * `Counter`: Accumulates POS counts from all sentences.
            
2. **Code with Detailed Inline Comments**:
    
    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Initialize an empty Counter for POS frequencies
    total_counts = Counter()
    
    # Loop through each POS-tagged sentence
    for sentence in tagged_sentences:
        # Count POS tags in each sentence
        counts = Counter(tag for word, tag in sentence)  # Counts tags in the current sentence
        total_counts.update(counts)  # Update total counts with current sentence counts
    
    # Sort POS counts by frequency in descending order
    sorted_tag_list = sorted(total_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)  # Sort by frequency
    
    # Display the most common tags
    most_common_tags = sorted_tag_list[:10]  # Show the top 10 most common tags
    print(most_common_tags)
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [('NN', 12500), ('IN', 9500), ('DT', 8500), ('JJ', 7500), ('VB', 6000), 
     ('RB', 5500), ('PRP', 4000), ('CC', 3500), ('VBD', 3000), ('TO', 2500)]
    ```
    
    * This output displays the most frequent POS tags, such as nouns (`NN`), prepositions (`IN`), and determiners (`DT`), and their respective counts across the entire corpus.

### Chunk 15: Visualizing POS Frequency Analysis

1. **Explanation**: This chunk uses `seaborn` to visualize the POS frequency analysis from the previous step.
    
    * **Modules/Classes Used**:
        
        * `pandas.DataFrame`: Organizes POS frequency data for plotting.
            
        * `seaborn.barplot`: Creates a bar chart of the POS tags and their frequencies.
            
2. **Code with Detailed Inline Comments**:
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Convert POS tag frequency data to a DataFrame for plotting
    most_common_tags_df = pd.DataFrame(most_common_tags, columns=['POS Tag', 'Frequency'])
    
    # Set up the figure and axes for plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))  # Define figure size
    
    # Create a bar plot of POS tag frequencies
    sns.barplot(x='POS Tag', y='Frequency', data=most_common_tags_df, ax=ax)
    
    # Label and title customization

# Hugging Face’s approach with Sample Output

<mark>We now willl focus on making the code shorter and leveraging the power of pre-trained models for tasks like tokenization, POS tagging, frequency analysis, and visualization. This approach will use the </mark> `transformers` <mark> library, which provides efficient implementations of various NLP models</mark>.

### Chunk 1 & 2: Tokenization and Frequency Distribution with Hugging Face

Using Hugging Face, tokenization and frequency distribution can be handled with a few lines. Here, I’ll use BERT’s tokenizer.

1. **Code Explanation**:
    
    * `AutoTokenizer`: Automatically loads the tokenizer for a given model (e.g., BERT).
        
    * `Counter`: Counts token frequencies.
        
2. **Code**:
    
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Load the tokenizer
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
    
    # Tokenize text
    text = "we'd like to book a flight from boston to london"
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
    print("Tokens:", tokens)  # Display tokenized words
    
    # Frequency distribution of tokens
    token_freq = Counter(tokens)
    print("Token Frequency:", token_freq)
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    Tokens: ['we', "'", 'd', 'like', 'to', 'book', 'a', 'flight', 'from', 'boston', 'to', 'london']
    Token Frequency: Counter({'to': 2, 'we': 1, ...})
    ```

### Chunk 3 & 5: Part-of-Speech Tagging with Hugging Face

Hugging Face models don’t directly provide POS tags. However, `pipeline` with `token-classification` and a POS model achieves this.

1. **Code Explanation**:
    
    * `pipeline`: Automatically sets up tasks like POS tagging when a model is specified.
        
    * `AutoModelForTokenClassification` + `AutoTokenizer`: For POS tagging.
        
2. **Code**:
    
    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline
    
    # Load POS tagging pipeline
    pos_pipeline = pipeline("token-classification", model="vblagoje/bert-english-uncased-finetuned-pos")
    
    # Run POS tagging
    pos_tags = pos_pipeline(text)
    print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)  # Shows words with POS tags
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [{'word': 'we', 'entity': 'PRON', 'score': 0.99}, {'word': "'", 'entity': 'PUNCT', 'score': 0.98}, ...]
    ```

### Chunk 6 & 7: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Dependency Parsing with Hugging Face

For NER, Hugging Face models can recognize entities with `pipeline("ner")`. Dependency parsing isn’t directly available, but transformers-based syntax parsers can be used.

1. **Code Explanation**:
    
    * `pipeline("ner")`: Recognizes entities like names, locations, etc.
        
2. **Code**:
    
    ```python
    # Load NER pipeline
    ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english")
    
    # Run NER on text
    entities = ner_pipeline(text)
    print("Named Entities:", entities)
    ```
    
3. **Sample Output**:
    
    ```python
    [{'word': 'boston', 'entity': 'LOC'}, {'word': 'london', 'entity': 'LOC'}]
    ```

### Chunk 10 & 11: Generating Frequency Distribution and WordCloud with Hugging Face

For word frequency and WordCloud, we’ll use tokenization frequency from Hugging Face models and standard visualization tools.

1. **Code Explanation**:
    
    * Tokenize and count word frequency using Hugging Face.
        
    * Generate WordCloud from frequencies.
        
2. **Code**:
    
    ```python
    from wordcloud import WordCloud
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Tokenize and count word frequencies
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(" ".join(movie_reviews.words()[:500]))  # Use a sample for speed
    word_freq = Counter(tokens)
    
    # Generate WordCloud
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=600, height=300, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(word_freq)
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
    ```

### Chunk 12 & 13: POS Frequency Analysis for the Movie Corpus

1. **Code Explanation**:
    
    * Apply the POS pipeline to sentences, count POS tags, and visualize.
        
2. **Code**:
    
    ```python
    # Sample movie review sentences and POS tagging
    sentences = [" ".join(sent) for sent in movie_reviews.sents()[:5]]  # Small sample for speed
    pos_counts = Counter()
    
    # Tag each sentence and accumulate POS counts
    for sent in sentences:
        pos_tags = pos_pipeline(sent)
        pos_counts.update(tag['entity'] for tag in pos_tags)
    
    print("POS Frequency:", pos_counts)
    ```
