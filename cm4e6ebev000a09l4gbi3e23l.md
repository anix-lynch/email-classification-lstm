### **2\. Key Metrics and Benchmarks**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Target Value (Benchmark)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Average Project Value (APV)** | The average revenue generated per custom AI project. | $100K–$1M+ | Higher APVs reflect the complexity and customization of solutions. |
| **Project Completion Time** | Average time required to deliver a project. | 6–12 months | Shorter timelines improve scalability and client satisfaction. |
| **Client Retention Rate** | Percentage of clients returning for additional projects or services. | &gt;70% | Repeat clients are a key driver of long-term profitability. |
| **Gross Margin** | Revenue minus direct costs (consulting, development). | 50–70% | Lower than SaaS due to high labor and development costs. |
| **Utilization Rate** | Percentage of time billable resources spend on revenue-generating activities. | &gt;80% | Indicates efficiency in resource allocation. |

### **3\. Unit Economics**

**Sample Inputs**:

* Number of projects: 20/year
    
* Average project value (APV): $250,000
    
* Average project cost: $100,000
    
* Retention rate: 75%
    
* Overhead costs (salaries, office): $1.5M/year
    

**Sample Outputs**:

1. **Annual Revenue**:
    
    * Formula: `Number of Projects × APV`
        
    * Calculation: `20 × $250,000 = $5,000,000`
        
2. **Gross Profit**:
    
    * Formula: `Revenue - Project Costs`
        
    * Calculation: `$5,000,000 - (20 × $100,000) = $3,000,000`
        
3. **Gross Margin**:
    
    * Formula: `(Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100`
        
    * Calculation: `($3,000,000 ÷ $5,000,000) × 100 = 60%`
        
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**:
    
    * Formula: `APV × Retention Rate ÷ (1 - Retention Rate)`
        
    * Calculation: `$250,000 × 0.75 ÷ (1 - 0.75) = $750,000`
        
5. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
    
    * Formula: `Marketing Spend ÷ New Clients`
        
    * Example Input: Marketing Spend = $500,000/year, New Clients = 10
        
    * Calculation: `$500,000 ÷ 10 = $50,000`
        
6. **Payback Period**:
    
    * Formula: `CAC ÷ APV`
        
    * Calculation: `$50,000 ÷ $250,000 = 0.2 years (~2.4 months)`
