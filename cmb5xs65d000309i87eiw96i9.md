Welcome to your first step into the delicious, powerful world of **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **Smithery**. If you’ve ever felt lost looking at agents, servers, YAML files, and plugins... imagine this instead:

> You’ve just walked into Yogurtland. There are flavors (LLMs), toppings (MCPs), and bases (agent runtimes). Let’s build your custom agent like a frozen yogurt masterpiece.

---

## 🥛 BASE = Agent Runtime (The Bowl)

This is where your agent lives. Just like the cup at Yogurtland, it defines what you can hold and how it feels.

| Base | Traits | Metaphor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🍦 Cursor | Paid, fast, smooth, but closed | Vanilla froyo with sugar boost 🌾 |
| 🌿 Windsurf | Open(ish), modern UI, less locked | Green tea soft serve 🍵 |
| 🧱 LangGraph | Open-source, structured flow | DIY granola bowl 🥜 |
| 🔧 CLI Agent | Custom script, most flexible | A paper cup you made yourself 🛠️ |
| 🪩 CrewAI | Agent orchestration, multi-agent | A large mixing tray 🍳 |
| 🤖 AutoGen | Multimodal orchestration | A buffet tray 🍽️ |

> **Verdict for beginners:** Cursor = Fast & fun, great for prototyping Windsurf = Good fallback with modern feel LangGraph = Ideal for long-term, open-source workflows

---

## 🍿 SYRUP = Agent Superpowers (Vital Organs)

These are the **must-have capabilities**. Without syrup, your froyo is bland. These are what make your agent functional, not just smart.

✅ If you just stick with these **7 syrup types**, you’ll have a *fully functioning, powerful AI agent*. Sprinkles and toppings (like ElevenLabs or TwitterBot) can come later.

here’s a **starter YAML schema** to represent your **core agent syrup setup** (must-have MCPs only) in a structured, plug-and-play way for Cursor or LangGraph:

---

## 🧾 `agent-mcp-config.yaml` (Core Syrup-Only MCP Schema)

```yaml
agent:
  name: ZeroShot Agent
  base: cursor
  llm:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4

mcp:
  memory:
    type: MemoryTool
    provider: smithery/mem0-memory-mcp
    config:
      store: local
      ttl: 1h

  retrieval:
    - name: ExaSearch
      type: web
      provider: exa
      config:
        top_k: 5

    - name: Context7
      type: document
      provider: upstash/context7-mcp
      config:
        docs_path: ./docs/
        format: markdown

  router:
    type: Toolbox
    provider: smithery/toolbox
    config:
      auto_route: true

  browser:
    type: Browserbase
    provider: browserbasehq/mcp-browserbase
    config:
      headless: true
      timeout: 10

  file:
    type: DriveTool
    provider: smithery/drive-tool
    config:
      storage: gdrive
      access_token: ${GDRIVE_API_TOKEN}

  email_calendar:
    email:
      provider: mailmcp/gmail
      config:
        auth_method: oauth
    calendar:
      provider: notionmcp/calendar
      config:
        sync_interval: 15min

  execution:
    terminal:
      provider: wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
      config:
        sandboxed: true
    code:
      provider: runtime/coderunner
      config:
        languages: [python, javascript]
```

---

### 🔧 How to Use It:

* Save as `agent-mcp-config.yaml`
    
* Load into Cursor (with `mcp-remote` plugin or LangGraph agent)
    
* Use `.env` file for secrets like tokens
    

---

## 🗝️ `.env` Example (for secure keys & config)

```plaintext
# 🌐 Web Search (Exa)
EXA_API_KEY=sk-exa-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# 📄 Document Retrieval (Context7 / Upstash)
UPSTASH_REST_TOKEN=upstash-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# 📂 Google Drive / File Access
GDRIVE_API_TOKEN=ya29.a0AfH6SMxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# 📧 Gmail (MailMCP)
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxx
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxx

# 📅 Notion Calendar
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# 🔐 Optional auth for memory or execution
MEMORY_API_KEY=mem0-xxxxxxxxxxxx
DESKTOP_CMD_AUTH_KEY=cmd-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

### ✅ What to Do:

1. Save this as `.env` in your project root
    
2. Make sure your agent loader (Cursor or LangGraph) loads env variables
    
3. Keep `.env` out of version control (`.gitignore` it!)
