Welcome to your first step into the delicious, powerful world of **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **Smithery**. If you’ve ever felt lost looking at agents, servers, YAML files, and plugins... imagine this instead:

> You’ve just walked into Yogurtland. There are flavors (LLMs), toppings (MCPs), and bases (agent runtimes). Let’s build your custom agent like a frozen yogurt masterpiece.

---

## 🥛 BASE = Agent Runtime (The Bowl)

This is where your agent lives. Just like the cup at Yogurtland, it defines what you can hold and how it feels.

| Base | Traits | Metaphor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🍦 Cursor | Paid, fast, smooth, but closed | Vanilla froyo with sugar boost 🌾 |
| 🌿 Windsurf | Open(ish), modern UI, less locked | Green tea soft serve 🍵 |
| 🧱 LangGraph | Open-source, structured flow | DIY granola bowl 🥜 |
| 🔧 CLI Agent | Custom script, most flexible | A paper cup you made yourself 🛠️ |
| 🪩 CrewAI | Agent orchestration, multi-agent | A large mixing tray 🍳 |
| 🤖 AutoGen | Multimodal orchestration | A buffet tray 🍽️ |

> **Verdict for beginners:** Cursor = Fast & fun, great for prototyping Windsurf = Good fallback with modern feel LangGraph = Ideal for long-term, open-source workflows

## 🍿 SYRUP = Agent Superpowers (Vital Organs)

These are the **must-have capabilities**. Without syrup, your froyo is bland. These are what make your agent functional, not just smart.
