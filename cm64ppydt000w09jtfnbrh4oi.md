### **Why Is Causal Inference a Trend in 2025?**

1. **Traditional AI (LLMs) Can Predict, Not Explain**:
    
    * **Before**: AI tools like GPT can say, "The man is likely to cheat based on patterns (correlation)."
        
    * **Problem**: They don’t tell **why** cheating happens. Is it **because the wife gained weight** or **because there's a sexier mistress**? Predictive models miss the cause.
        
    * **Need for Causal Inference**: In 2025, users demand smarter AI that not only predicts **what will happen** but also explains **why it happens** and answers **what-if scenarios**.
        
2. **Agentic AI Requires Decision-Making**:
    
    * **Trend**: Agentic AI needs to make autonomous decisions based on causes, not just patterns. For example:
        
        * Should the AI recommend couples therapy for the wife, or block access to the mistress?
            
        * Without causal reasoning, the AI might choose interventions that don’t work.
            
3. **Why It Wasn’t Used Before**:
    
    * Lack of accessible tools: Probabilistic frameworks like **Pyro** and **DoWhy** have only recently made causal inference approachable.
        
    * Computational challenges: Running causal inference requires dealing with **counterfactuals** (what-if worlds), which are more complex than simple predictions.

### **Causal Inference with Wife and Mistress Example**

#### **Scenario**: Why do men cheat?

Variables:

* **X1 (Wife gains weight)**
    
* **X2 (Mistress is sexier)**
    
* **C (Confounder: Marriage dissatisfaction)**
    
* **Y (Cheating)**
    

---

### **Step 1: Correlation vs. Causation**

* **Observation**: Men whose wives gain weight and have sexier mistresses are more likely to cheat.
    
* **Problem**: Correlation does not mean causation.
    
    * Is the man cheating **because** the wife gained weight?
        
    * Or is he already dissatisfied (confounder) and the mistress is an opportunity?
        

---

### **Step 2: Causal Graphs**

We can represent this as a **causal model** (graph):

```plaintext
    X1 (Wife gains weight) → Y (Cheating)
    X2 (Sexy mistress) → Y (Cheating)
    C (Marriage dissatisfaction) → X1, X2, Y
```

* **Explanation**:
    
    * Dissatisfaction (C) causes the wife to gain weight (X1) and leads to cheating (Y).
        
    * A sexier mistress (X2) increases the likelihood of cheating, but only if dissatisfaction exists.
        

---

### **Step 3: Counterfactuals (What-Ifs)**

Causal inference uses **counterfactuals** to ask:

1. **What if the wife didn’t gain weight (X1)?**
    
    * Does cheating still happen because of the mistress?
        
2. **What if there was no sexy mistress (X2)?**
    
    * Would dissatisfaction (C) still lead to cheating?
        

---

### **Step 4: Tools Like Pyro or DoWhy**

We can now use tools like Pyro and DoWhy to test these causal relationships and counterfactuals programmatically.

---

#### **Code Example with DoWhy**

```python
import dowhy
from dowhy import CausalModel
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "wife_weight_gain": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000),  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    "sexy_mistress": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000),  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    "dissatisfaction": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000),  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    "cheating": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000),  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
})

# Define the causal model
model = CausalModel(
    data=data,
    treatment="wife_weight_gain",
    outcome="cheating",
    common_causes=["dissatisfaction", "sexy_mistress"]
)

# Identify causal effect
identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()
print(identified_estimand)

# Estimate the causal effect
estimate = model.estimate_effect(
    identified_estimand,
    method_name="backdoor.propensity_score_matching"
)
print("Causal Estimate:", estimate.value)

# Check counterfactual
refute = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate, method_name="placebo")
print(refute)
```

### **What Happens Here?**

1. **Input**:
    
    * `wife_weight_gain` (X1), `sexy_mistress` (X2), `dissatisfaction` (C), and `cheating` (Y).
        
2. **Output**:
    
    * The causal effect of `wife_weight_gain` on cheating is calculated, adjusting for `dissatisfaction` and `sexy_mistress`.
        
    * **Counterfactuals**: The tool tests whether cheating would still happen if X1 (wife weight gain) didn’t occur.
        

---

### **Sample Output**

```python
Causal Estimate: 0.15
Refutation: No significant change in estimate after placebo test
```

* **Interpretation**:
    
    * Weight gain has a small causal effect on cheating.
        
    * Most of the cheating is driven by dissatisfaction (C) and the presence of a sexy mistress (X2).

### **Why This Matters for Agentic AI in 2025**

1. **Better Decision-Making**:  
    Agentic AI can now:
    
    * **Explain actions**: "The man cheats because of dissatisfaction, not the wife’s weight."
        
    * **Recommend interventions**: Focus on fixing dissatisfaction, not superficial factors like weight.
        
2. **Transparent AI**:  
    Users trust AI more when it provides **causal reasoning** instead of black-box predictions.
    
3. **What’s New?**
    
    * Tools like **Pyro** and **DoWhy** bring causality into AI, making it possible to simulate real-world "what-if" scenarios.
